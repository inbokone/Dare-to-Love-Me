4
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,320
Shall we

5
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,363
head home?

6
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,535
Yes, let us do that.

7
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,718
- Shall we go?
- Shall we?

8
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:44,854
After you.

9
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,939
Okay.

10
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,741
EPISODE 10
DAY 1 OF GOING AGAINST REASON

11
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,691
{\an8}BASED ON THE WEBTOON
DARE TO LOVE ME BY SUN WOO

12
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,190
I…

13
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,693
I like you, Master.

14
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,621
<i>Master, if it is all right with you,</i>

15
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,790
<i>would you like to spend time
with me tomorrow?</i>

16
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,708
Wait.

17
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,836
He just asked me out on a date!

18
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,341
<i>I'd love to.</i>

19
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:31,080
My eye bags are so dark
from not getting a wink of sleep.

20
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,498
What do I do?

21
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,214
I am here, Master.

22
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,765
I'm sorry.

23
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,933
Did you wait for long?

24
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,435
You're very…

25
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,108
You're very beautiful.

26
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,444
What?

27
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,365
What should we do today?

28
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,118
Well, actually,

29
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,037
I planned our day out.

30
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,917
"Nice places to go with your lover."

31
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,504
HOW TO CRUSH YOUR FIRST DATE

32
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,423
YOU MUST MAP OUT THE DAY AND TIME…

33
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,301
Map out the day?

34
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,972
I shall take the lead today.

35
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,308
Okay.

36
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:39,982
Oh.

37
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,154
Let us go.

38
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,042
I spent all night
thinking about what we could do

39
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,294
and decided it would be perfect

40
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,214
to spend time in a quiet place.

41
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,634
I know you have been stressed due to work,

42
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,178
so I hope you can

43
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,348
relax your exhausted body
and mind with me.

44
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,394
It's so nice here.

45
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,111
Oh, right.

46
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,865
BOARDWALK TRAIL

47
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,910
What's that?

48
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,294
You brought this too?

49
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,338
I am new to dating.

50
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,424
I wanted to be prepared

51
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,428
so that you would not catch a cold.

52
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,722
Is this your first date ever?

53
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,642
Does that mean
you've never had a girlfriend?

54
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,647
As the heir to lead the village,

55
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,735
my priorities have been
cultural assets and the village's affairs.

56
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,033
I did not know
how pleasing it would be to spend time

57
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,659
with someone I love.

58
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,372
It is heaven on earth.

59
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,666
Oh, you.

60
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,469
I feel the same way.

61
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,056
Being this close to you

62
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,142
in the same place…

63
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,480
makes me so happy.

64
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,693
Goodness, Master.

65
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,322
Calm down.

66
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,115
Do not race too fast.

67
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,870
This is amazing.

68
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,297
They say eating grilled clams
by the beach in winter is the best.

69
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,508
I love grilled clams.

70
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,803
Hang on.

71
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,306
It'd be a sin to eat this precious meal
without alcohol.

72
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,811
Oh right, you don't drink.

73
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,608
One bottle of soju, please.

74
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,152
What?

75
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,738
I cannot let you sin.

76
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,954
Here you go.

77
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,505
Here, cheers.

78
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,644
You should have some.

79
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,771
I think I ate most of it.

80
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,275
I'm full.

81
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,444
Here.

82
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,322
If I may.

83
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,909
Are you okay?

84
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,870
Yoon-bok, no! That's soju!

85
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,544
Yoon-bok!

86
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,298
Yoon-bok!

87
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,050
Wake up!

88
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,347
I'm sorry.

89
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,515
I shouldn't have drunk.

90
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,728
No, it was my fault for being careless.

91
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,608
You had emptied half of the glass,

92
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,569
so I was able to wake up before sunset.

93
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,076
If we ride the boat to the island,

94
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,411
we will be able to see a beautiful sunset.

95
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,998
We must hurry
as the last ride is at 6 p.m.

96
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,750
Okay.

97
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,212
Island?

98
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,303
{\an8}OPERATING TO HWADO

99
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,807
{\an8}LAST BOAT LEAVES AT 6 P.M.
DURING WINTER, AT 5 P.M.

100
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,725
It looks like they're done for the day.

101
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,061
What a disaster.

102
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,356
My apologies.

103
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,401
It's okay. It's not the end of the world.

104
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,529
I got to see the lake and eat good food.

105
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,740
I'm a bit disappointed to miss the boat,

106
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,992
but I still had a good time.

107
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,880
<i>So Phony has a burn on his arm.</i>

108
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,217
<i>I wonder if he's one of the employees.</i>

109
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,805
<i>The only person I haven't checked is…</i>

110
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,226
Listen up, everyone!
Today is a very important day.

111
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,688
Get your heads on straight
and be on your toes.

112
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:11,605
Yes, sir.

113
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,284
Are you serious?

114
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,286
You should be out in the hall, not…

115
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,625
Here.

116
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,421
Come with me.

117
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,233
You've got a nice place.

118
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,818
You really made it.

119
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,362
Change into this.

120
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,865
I'll have to make you
that pear drink again if you get a cold.

121
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,718
It's kind of big on me.

122
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,270
What are you looking at?

123
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,064
What?

124
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,275
Oh, I'm sorry.

125
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,862
Your shirt's kind of big on me,

126
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,782
so I just wanted to ask you

127
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,785
if you had anything smaller.

128
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,763
I'll see you outside.

129
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,660
I'm a bit disappointed to miss the boat…

130
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,372
I'm a bit disappointed to miss the boat…

131
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,878
Master Kim said it was all right,

132
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,672
but that was a white lie for my sake.

133
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,593
I disappointed her.

134
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,595
What must I do now?

135
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,391
I must kneel and beg for…

136
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,522
She will not want that.

137
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,027
How must I ask for forgiveness?

138
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,670
SHIN YOON-BOK

139
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,642
<i>Master Kim,</i>

140
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,853
<i>I apologize for failing to show you
everything I had prepared.</i>

141
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,316
<i>Will you forgive my mistake?</i>

142
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,112
UNREAD

143
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,491
Why is she not reading my message?

144
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,119
Could it be?

145
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,459
LEE DO-YEONG

146
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,174
You are receiving
a lot of messages, Master.

147
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,634
Why are you not checking them?

148
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,512
Oh, they aren't important.

149
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,472
I see.

150
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,768
I should block them.

151

Has she…

154
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,070
blocked me?

155
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,411
There is no way she would do that.

156

UNREAD

157
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,043
My eyes are deceiving me.

158
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,714
It would be absurd to think
she has blocked me.

159
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:47,756
That is nonsense.

160
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,677
I saw it wrong.

161

Damn it!

163
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,908
How could this happen to me?

164
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,660
No.

165
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,830
This cannot be real.

166
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,734
Oh no.

167
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,840
<i>I had a great time yesterday, Yoon-bok.</i>

168
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,052
<i>Let's do what we couldn't do yesterday
next time.</i>

169

00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,405
Did you have a good night?

172
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,866
Good morning, Yoon-bok.

173
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,206
Why are you here so early?

174
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,878
They say the early bird gets the worm.

175
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,922
I'm not really into worms.

176
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,507
Noted. Now, let us start our day.

177
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,899
- Master.
- Yoon-bok.

178
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,779
I hear it is chilly today.

179
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,905
Is it?

180
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,242
Allow me to cover you up.

181
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,916
Yoon-bok!

182
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,878
I'll be back then.

183
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,629
Take care, Master!

184
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,714
Wait a minute.

185
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,803
What's going on here?

186
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,349
Are you two…

187
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,320
Are you two still distant?

188
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,364
What?

189
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,909
Try to get along, will you?

190
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,911
It's hard being caught between you two.

191
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,454
What are you talking about?

192
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:06,955
I'm leaving.

193
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,460
Jeez.

194
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,087
Don't mind her, my friend.

195
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,589
I'm always on your side.

196
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,133
Jeez.

197
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,135
It is okay.

198
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,389
Yes, ma'am.

199
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,976
I got the sample you sent.

200
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:32,022
I won't disappoint you with my design.

201
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,158
SHIN YOON-BOK

202
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,831
<i>It is almost time for lunch, Master.</i>

203
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,917
<i>Please make sure to eat.</i>

204
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,427
<i>Thanks. Have a good lunch too.</i>

205
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,597
<i>I miss you.</i>

206
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,226
I MISS YOU

207
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,441
What, is it good news?

208
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,071
Extremely good news.

209
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,502
I shall clock out now.

210
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,171
Right on the dot?

211
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,923
Hey, you!

212
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,842
See you tomorrow.

213
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,927
That little…

214
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,562
Jeez, I'm so hungry.

215
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,780
Don't call me.

216
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,712
HANDS OFF, KIM HONG-HAK!

217
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:32,476
CAFE SMELL GRAND OPENING
FREE COUPON

218
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,030
Is something bothering you?

219
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,368
Could I use this?

220
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,661
Of course.

221
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,663
You get one free food

222
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,207
for one concern.

223
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,335
Well, my concern is…

224
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,213
I can't…

225
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,092
stand injustice.

226
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,593
Excuse me?

227
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:11,098
When I saw a man
threaten a woman recently,

228
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,226
I couldn't help but to…

229
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,023
That's how I got this.

230
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,362
Gosh, you're so cool!

231
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,697
Just a moment.

232
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,284
I have just the right thing
for a hero like you.

233
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:45,215
When justice wins,
it's worth celebrating, not worrying.

234
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,093
So let's open
the most expensive drink at our café

235
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,011
and give a toast.

236
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,055
Goodness me.

237
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:17,914
Writer Kim,

238
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,375
why did you ask to meet here?

239
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,421
It's a new and popular spot.

240
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,424
Oh, so you're a writer.

241
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,884
<i>Strong Lady Oh Yun-a</i>?

242
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,677
I'm a big fan of the series.

243
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,722
It's the talk of the town these days.

244
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,849
Is that so?

245
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,350
Thank you.

246
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,521
I'm the Oh Yun-a in the webcomic.

247
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,191
In other words,

248
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:47,652
I'm what you call his "muse."

249
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,612
Really?

250
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,990
Well, he sure made you look better
in the drawing.

251
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,952
You're very talented.

252
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,957
It'd be awesome if you could design

253
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,460
a pretty logo for my café.

254
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,462
A logo?

255
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,006
Should I draw you one?

256
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,425
Are you serious?

257
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,177
Thank you so much.

258
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,181
You've got such a great personality too.

259
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,148
Listen here.

260
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,610
I'd like a glass of the same.

261
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,532
Wait.

262
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,704
You're supposed to share your worries
and she'll recommend--

263
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,956
I have no worries.

264
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:42,999
Give me a glass.

265
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,793
Why don't you drink something else?

266
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,803
How much is it

267
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,389
if I use this?

268
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,224
Can I pay in installments?

269
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,725
Come on, Writer Kim.

270
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,273
Tonight is on the house.

271
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,275
Really?

272
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,446
Thank you. I'll come back again.

273
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,201
Oh dear.

274
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,203
I have let my emotions take over me again

275
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,497
and came to see her without asking.

276
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,293
I must call her first.

277
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,424
Why is that man here?

278
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:41,850
Kim Hong-do!

279
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,355
It's been so long.

280
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,566
I missed you.

281
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,453
I missed…

282
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,415
It has been a while.

283
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,001
What the hell?

284
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,711
Yoon-bok?

285
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,255
Why are <i>you</i> hugging me?

286
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,506
I was surprised as well.

287
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,427
I did not expect to see you here again.

288
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,472
Whatever.

289
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,641
Why are you ignoring my messages, Hong-do?

290
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,477
Did you block me?

291
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,729
Yes, so why don't you
block yourself from my life?

292
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:32,150
I was too immature to realize it then,
but now I know.

293
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,528
You're not a fake, Hong-do.
You're a diamond.

294
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,783
So I was hoping to go back to you.

295
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,326
You crazy…

296
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,873
- Leave.
- Why?

297
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,793
Is it because of him?
Should we talk in private?

298
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,753
- What about tomorrow?
- You little…

299
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,714
She and I have plans tomorrow.

300
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,013
- The day after tomorrow then.
- On that day,

301
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,015
she will be cleaning her home.

302
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,518
- What about the weekend?
- The weekend

303
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,188
is the three-year anniversary
of her brother's webcomic debut.

304
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:15,360
She will have a good time with me
and some close friends.

305
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,905
I'm not asking you.

306
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,615
Why do you keep answering for her?

307
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,617
Are you her manager or something?

308
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,952
I'm not her manager.

309
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,379
I'm her boyfriend.

310
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,930
That's right, we're dating.

311
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,733
Hong-do's such an easy girl!

312
00:28:56,526 --> 00:29:00,363
She holds hands
with any guy who feels her out.

313
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,031
Master.

314
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,244
Do not look back.

So do not ever look at her again

320
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:00,632
and speak of her again
with that crude mouth.

321
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,513
Oh my. He's so cool.

322
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,731
He's so cool.

323
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,775
Is he even human?

324
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,492
Let us go.

What is going on?

327
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,517
What is it?

00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,082
Care to explain this?

332
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,668
Take a look.

This is absurd.

You have already sent us
his marriage letter.

339
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,653
How can you insult our family like this?

340
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:49,198
Though he may be a member
of the respected Woorim family,

341
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,993
I will not let my daughter marry
under these circumstances.

342
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,161
No, I cannot!

343
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,829
Calm yourself.

344
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,874
I will find out what happened.

345
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,500
So be patient and wait.

346
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:03,922
Enough with the empty promises.
You must solve this problem.

347
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:08,635
If you fail to do so,
I will not just sit back and watch.

348
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,488
How must I deal with this problem?

349
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,791
Care for a drink?

350
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,675
It's been so long
since we've drank together.

351
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:58,142
It's crazy how you're in the same mood
as you were 46 years ago.

352
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,020
You were sad then about leaving me,

353
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,147
and now you're sad
about your grandson who left.

354
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,608
I didn't mean to,

355
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,944
but I overheard your conversation
with that man.

356
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,947
It's not the Joseon dynasty anymore.

357
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,116
Why are you two trying
to control your grandchildren's life?

358
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:16,577
That boy has a duty he must fulfill.

359
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,372
Have you had no regrets

360
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,708
about giving everything up for that duty?

361
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,585
Whoever is entrusted with this duty
has no choice.

362
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,593
My son once tried
to make a different choice.

363
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,765
I allowed him to open the village gate
as he asked me to.

364
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:42,228
<i>- But due to my decision…</i>
- My lord!

365
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,734
I lost…

366
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,155
my son.

367
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,665
So that's why you've kept
the village gate closed to the world.

368
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,259
But did you know?

369
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,346
I hit rock bottom when you left me.

370
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:23,478
I sobbed my eyes out
with resentment burning inside me.

371
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,442
Yes, fulfilling your duty is important.

372
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:33,029
But what value does it have
when it causes you

373
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,906
to hurt the people you love?

374
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,911
No duty is worth more than a person.

375
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,757
That hits the spot.

376
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,927
What's the occasion?

377
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,430
I'm not complaining, but it's not like you
to offer to drink first.

378
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,766
Goodness.

379
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:05,394
Seeing Lord Shin so worried
because of Young Master

380
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:09,023
reminds me of my son
and makes me want to drink.

381
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,944
That's the thing with children.

382
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,570
You get worried when they're close by.

383
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,489
You get worried when they're apart.

384
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:20,034
You talk like someone
who has children of his own.

385
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,955
I have a son and a daughter.

386
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,290
What?

387
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:30,670
So you've been stuck in here
apart from your children?

388
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,757
You must miss them so much.

389
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:39,929
It's better for my children
to not see their no-good father.

390
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,105
Let's just drink.

391
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:01,784
That Young Master
struck me as a decent young man.

392
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,121
How has he angered his elders?

393
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,832
The thing is…

394
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,022
It looks like he's dating someone
outside the village.

395
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,733
So what you're saying is,

396
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,278
this is who he is involved with?

397
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,615
That's right.

398
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,038
<i>She has blocked you, has she not?</i>

399
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,207
According to Lady Yeoju,

400
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,834
the video has spread to the village.

401
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,628
<i>…and speak of her again…</i>

402
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,672
Do not be concerned
with what the villagers say about me.

403
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,175
- However--
- Are you getting close

404
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,843
to catching Phony?

405
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,141
We received a tip-off about a Chinese
smuggling ring entering the country,

406
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,060
and Lady Yi-bok is on their tail.

407
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,673
It has been confirmed.

408
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,057
I'd like to ask some questions.

409
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,353
How'd it go, Detective Shin?

410
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,854
<i>They're confirmed
to be the Chinese smugglers,</i>

411
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,982
<i>and I also saw them check in at the hotel.</i>

412
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,526
Turns out they made a reservation
at a restaurant.

413
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,070
And it happens to be…

414
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,948
- Seongsangwan?
<i>- Yes.</i>

415
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:07,535
It seems likely that they're here
for a deal with Phony.

416
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,293
Friday?

417
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,342
It opens this Friday at Seongsangwan.

418
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:27,138
It's my first-ever event at Camille,

419
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,681
so please drop by if you can.

420
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,434
Yes, I will be there.

421
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,565
Oh, right.

422
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,233
Have you seen the video?

423
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,239
Yes, I have.

424
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,492
You must have been shocked.

425
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,286
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

426
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,163
Do not be.

427
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,957
I am all right as long as you are.

428
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,128
However, I do have a question.

429
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,087
What is it?

430
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:05,634
What does a "world-shaking stud" mean?

431
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,138
- What?
- Why would I shake the world?

432
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,392
Oh, that.

433
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,814
It means you are that…

434
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,654
No, I don't want to say it.

435
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,867
What is it? Please tell me.

436
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,494
I don't want to.

437
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,995
Please.

438
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,206
No, I can't.

439
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,833
- Come on, Master.
- It means you're that cute!

440
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:41,629
It means you're cute enough
to shake the world.

441
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,632
Excuse me?

442
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,552
Am I really cute?

443
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,887
What?

444
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,141
I cannot see
how I could be considered cute.

445
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,728
People have told me

446
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:01,357
my charms are being mature
and dignified, not cute.

447
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:02,900
What?

448
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,113
And in my eyes,

449
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,198
it is <i>you</i>

450
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,700
who shakes the world.

451
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,244
Oh my gosh!

452
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,455
Says the world-shaking stud.

453
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,209
No, you shake the world more than I do.

454
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,128
No, I don't. You do.

455
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,964
No one can come close
to how you shake the world.

456
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,549
Oh, stop it!

457
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,843
You could shake
the entire world out there.

458
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,177
CHINESE SMUGGLING RING 'GEOMANG'

459
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,429
SEONGSANGWAN, FRIDAY
14:00

460
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,476
I told you not to bother anymore.

461
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,270
Yi-bok, you must not
jump into danger alone.

462
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,106
I'm a cop. I can handle this.

463
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,316
You really must not.

464
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,234
- Okay, go rest.
- Yi-bok.

465
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,830
CULTURAL HERITAGE ADMINISTRATION

466
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:58,390
These have been brought here
straight from France.

467
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:02,478
Please keep them safe
until the fashion show.

468
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,772
Good work.

469
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,608
I shall keep them in the storage.

470
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,443
By the way,

471
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,571
what is the consensus among the villagers?

472
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:17,826
They must be opening up,
considering the pop-up store.

473
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,087
Contrary to my expectations,

474
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,549
Lady Camille is getting along well
with the villagers.

475
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,969
She must not be
as cranky as I thought she was.

476
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:51,795
Lord Shin.

477
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,385
Did you call for me?

478
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:03,432
Precious assets
are being stored in the village,

479
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:07,311
so we must make sure
thieves do not get near them.

480
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:10,314
Inspect every person
who goes through Seongsan Gate.

481
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,358
Do not go easy on the villagers.

482
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,275
Yes, my lord.

483
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,111
Be careful.

484
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,654
Drive safe.

485
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,448
I'll see you there.

486
00:45:59,089 --> 00:45:59,923
All right.

487
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,886
Detective Kim and I
will tail the Chinese from the hotel.

488
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:07,306
Detective Shin, you stand by
and welcome them at Seongsangwan.

489
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:08,765
- Understood.
- And you two.

490
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,309
Stake out near the restaurant

491
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:12,311
and report in
if you see anyone suspicious.

492
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,313
Once the transaction begins,

493
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:17,483
we'll barge in
on Detective Shin's cue, okay?

494
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,775
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

495
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:19,735
All right.

496
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:21,904
Right.

497
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,114
There's going to be
a big event at Seongsangwan,

498
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,366
so stay alert and watch carefully.

499
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,495
Look for anyone wearing
a black cap and black clothes.

500
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,955
Lastly, stay safe.

501
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,248
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

502
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,807
Look this way, please.

503
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,309
Give us a pose.

504
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:58,774
{\an8}SEONGSAN VILLAGE

505
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:12,287
SEONGSANGWAN

506
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,205
It's Camille!

507
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,184
Look here, please.

508
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,004
Hey, let's go.

509
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,769
Hey, Yoon-bok.

510
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,981
Are you on your way, Master?

511
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,567
Yeah, I left ten minutes ago.

512
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,486
Then I shall see you at Seongsangwan.

513
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:29,990
Master?

514
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,877
<i>Master.</i>

515
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,337
Just a minute, Yoon-bok.

516
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,304
What?

517
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,620
Master.

518
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,695
Master!

519
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,364
<i>Master!</i>

520
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,620
<i>Master!</i>

521
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,590
Where are you, Yun-a?

522
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:34,573
Over there.

523
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,417
Master!

524
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,461
Yoon-bok.

525
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,004
Are you all right?

526
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,465
She's showing signs of a light concussion.

527
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,468
First aid has been administered,
but she should go to the hospital.

528
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,094
No, I need to go to Seoul.

529
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,846
You must go to the hospital.

530
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,389
You need treatment.

531
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,682
Thank you for your help.

532
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,311
Master.

533
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,772
You must not be stubborn about this.

534
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:11,318
The pop-up store is more important
to me than getting treatment.

535
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,410
How did this happen?

536
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,331
I don't know. It all happened so quickly.

537
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,043
When I got out
because of a minor collision,

538
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,170
I think someone hit my head with a weapon.

539
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,090
Who would do that?

540
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,218
They took something out of the car.

541
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:43,934
A pair of shoes and…

542
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,983
It was some kind of box for a folding fan.

543
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:55,737
A folding fan?

544
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,867
These are the three cultural assets
France will be returning to us.

545
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,581
Are the cultural assets from France
kept in Seongsan Village?

546
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,834
Yes, I believe so.

547
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,294
Inform my grandfather and check.

548
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,420
Okay.

549
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,594
- Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.

550
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,316
Is she still not answering?

551
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,279
HONG-DO KIM

552
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,282
What's going on, Hong-do Kim?

553
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:43,034
<i>I'm sorry,
but I got into an accident on the way.</i>

554
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,619
<i>I'll hurry there.</i>

555
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,912
An accident?

556
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,706
Are you hurt?

557
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,207
Okay.

558
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,709
All right.

559
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,336
She's on her way.

560
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,548
Greetings.

561
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,259
You're here early, Administrator Lee.

562
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,053
It seems the event is starting late.

563
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:05,015
That's ridiculous.
Would you like some champagne?

564
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:43,136
I was inspired by the <i>pichohye
</i>I saw at Seongsan Village.

565
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,262
What do you think?

566
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,097
Look.

567
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,226
Are you okay, Hong-do Kim?

568
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,353
Yes, I'm fine.

569
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:54,981
Go to the hospital first.

570
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,232
Let us go.

571
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,404
OH YUN-A

572
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,114
Please excuse me.

573
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,075
What did you find out?

574
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,911
The folding fan in the village is a fake?

575
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,708
All right.

576
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,632
<i>They're going in.</i>

577
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,302
Did you talk to Madam Camille?

578
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:07,595
She said I could go.

579
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:11,182
I shall look up the nearest hospital.

580
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,030
SEONGSANGWAN, FRIDAY
CHINESE SMUGGLING RING 'GEOMANG'

581
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,950
Please wait here, Master.

582
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:29,868
Okay.

583
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,895
It seems likely that they're here
for a deal with Phony.

584
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,359
Is there a problem?

585
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,486
Out of the way.

586
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,460
Yi-bok!

587
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,922
Are you all right?

588
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:27,050
I think they're here to meet Phony.

589
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,434
What the heck? Follow them.

590
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:37,602
Don't strike alone.

591
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,062
Yes, sir.

592
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,568
Young Master!

593
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,612
I sent my people. What happened?

594
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:57,956
What happened?

595
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,041
He asked where the back door was

596
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,043
and started running when I asked why.

597
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,962
That's nonsense! Let go of me.

598
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:05,547
I thought he was suspicious.

599
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,382
But who are you?

600
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:08,550
Oh, right.

601
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,386
We're the police. Just a moment.

602
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,931
You work for
the Cultural Heritage Administration?

603
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,099
I'm a civil servant.

604
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:22,939
Is this yours?

605
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,274
Yes, why?

606
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:37,495
This is a cultural asset
that was stolen from Seongsan Village.

607
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,997
What are you talking about?

608
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,248
That's not mine!

609
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,708
You just said it was yours.

610
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,835
- It's not!
- We'll talk at the station.

611
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:49,257
I swear that's not mine!

612
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,633
Please believe me!

613
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,428
Please drop by the station
to give a statement.

614
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,221
- All right.
- Okay.

615
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,393
What a strange incident.

616
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,573
Tell me what happened before your arrest.

617
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,079
I treated myself
to a pair of Camille shoes.

618
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,207
<i>- I put them down for a moment…</i>
- What the heck?

619
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,584
Hey!

620
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,462
Stop right there!

621
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,547
<i>…and the owner pounced on me</i>

622
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:33,176
when I asked him where the back door was.

623
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,347
<i>Are his words the truth</i>

624
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,849
<i>or a pure lie?</i>

625
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:49,108
I feel like I should apologize to you.

626
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,529
You've spent so much time
trying to catch Phony,

627
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,365
but it seems I'll be taking the credit.

628
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:59,202
That is no problem.
You have lightened my burden.

629
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:03,623
They say it's hard to see
what's under one's nose.

630
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:07,126
Who would've thought
that Phony had been conducting business

631
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,294
at Seongsangwan?

632
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:12,423
If I had known earlier,
I would've informed you.

633
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,635
- Are you done?
- Yes.

634
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,304
I wrote everything I saw and heard.

635
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,347
Great.

636
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,432
- Could you come to my desk?
- Sure.

637
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:30,233
<i>It was only a conjecture
by the investigation team</i>

638
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:33,111
<i>that Phony had been using
Seongsangwan as a meeting place.</i>

639
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:37,740
<i>So how is Jun-ho so sure?</i>

640
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:12,567
SEONGSANGWAN

641
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,090
FOLDING FAN

642
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,370
{\an8}What do you want with me?

643
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:52,542
{\an8}I intend to help you take over
as the head of Seongsan Village.

644
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:55,128
{\an8}By the way, what are you going
to do about Hong-do Kim?

645
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,213
{\an8}<i>Will she be coming to work?</i>

646
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,297
{\an8}<i>I'm not sure.</i>

647
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,258
{\an8}We're closed, Young Master.

648
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:03,720
{\an8}The real Phony seems
to be here in Seongsangwan.

649
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:07,098
{\an8}- Hong-do.
- Yes?

650
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:09,559
{\an8}<i>I didn't expect you to contact me first.</i>

651
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,018
{\an8}<i>This is just the beginning.</i>

652
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:12,520
{\an8}Excuse me?

653

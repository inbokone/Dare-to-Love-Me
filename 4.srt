1
00:00:00,114 --> 00:00:02,371
Does anyone want to participate in this competition?

2
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:03,340
- I’ll do it! - I’ll do it!

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,103
Then… maybe tell your friend to give them something like a memento?

4
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:07,714
Things that, even if 10 years have passed,

5
00:00:07,983 --> 00:00:10,140
this item will still remind them of your friend.

6
00:00:10,251 --> 00:00:13,983
Give me back my meatballs!

7
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,528
I can’t believe I can do it!

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,426
I flew back here just to sort this out.

9
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:23,202
Why else would I come back at all?

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,254
If Chad doesn’t come back with me, all this will have been for nothing.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,730
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

12
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,631
Did you win?

13
00:01:57,557 --> 00:01:59,007
I thought you went away.

14
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:00,706
Went where?

15
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,906
I thought you left for France with Aunt Aun.

16
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:06,736
My mom left but I stayed.

17
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:16,802
You want to stay here so much that you choose to leave me.

18
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:21,134
I’ve never left you.

19
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:27,022
Mom hasn’t come to pick me up yet. Can I go home with you?

20
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:47,902
It’s my fault.

21
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,011
I left you.

22
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,059
If you choose to stay here,

23
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,204
I’ll let you.

24
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,702
You told me…

25
00:03:12,112 --> 00:03:13,567
you want to go to med school here.

26
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,911
I hope you can make your goal come true.

27
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:21,013
If you fail to get into a med school,

28
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,611
you need to go to live with me right away.

29
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:27,324
You will have no other excuse.

30
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,115
Do we have a deal?

31
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,202
Deal.

32
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:38,207
Chadjen, you promise me.

33
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:41,924
You need to keep your word.

34
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:45,114
Yes.

35
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:54,257
That’s great.

36
00:03:56,635 --> 00:03:57,844
Did you really think I would go?

37
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:00,808
Anyone would want to go.

38
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,863
This is France we are talking about.

39
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:05,151
But I don’t.

40
00:04:14,223 --> 00:04:15,816
I won the race.

41
00:04:16,078 --> 00:04:17,441
I have a gold medal like you.

42
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:20,370
If you didn’t help me, I would be in trouble.

43
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:22,570
Good.

44
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:24,306
Keep the medal well.

45
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,853
I planned to give it to you.

46
00:04:30,702 --> 00:04:33,413
Since you didn’t go anywhere, I’d better keep it.

47
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:38,859
I have decided.

48
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,411
I allow you to get back into our group.

49
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,845
What?

50
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,091
When did you kick me out?

51
00:04:46,737 --> 00:04:48,568
When you disappeared and told me nothing.

52
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:00,700
Did you have dinner?

53
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:02,834
No.

54
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:06,401
My mom is cooking a big meal to celebrate my win.

55
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:10,957
Do you want to join us?

56
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:14,490
(I don’t know what Chadjen is thinking.)

57
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,567
(But at least I’m sure he made the right decision.)

58
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:22,063
(For me, the best thing is that all five of us are still together.)

59
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,708
(We still have a lot of time to have fun together.)

60
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:28,011
Stop pulling my jacket. You’re stretching it.

61
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,420
(I am now in 11th grade.)

62
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,115
(Everyone is saying that I am one year older.)

63
00:05:40,454 --> 00:05:43,856
(But for me, everything is just the same.)

64
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:47,302
(I’m still me but now I’m in the 11th grade.)

65
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,872
(My everyday life is quite tiring.)

66
00:05:51,428 --> 00:05:52,601
(For example, this morning.)

67
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:54,600
Som.

68
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,872
Now, you are in 11th grade.

69
00:05:57,241 --> 00:06:00,379
Do you figure out where you want to go to college and what to study?

70
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,579
Don’t be neglectful.

71
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:07,822
Some kids lay out their plans since they are in 7th grade.

72
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,137
7th grade? You are exaggerating it.

73
00:06:11,302 --> 00:06:12,428
No, she’s not.

74
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:20,771
If my daughter wants to attend a pricey college, I will drop dead first.

75
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:22,339
Dad.

76
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,109
Chad, what do you want to study in college?

77
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:29,109
I want to attend a med school.

78
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,613
He’s an exemplary kid.

79
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,057
You have planned it all out, haven’t you?

80
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,702
I’m sure you can get in.

81
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,511
You’ve always gotten good grades since you were in kindergarten.

82
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:44,534
Eat a lot to boost your brain.

83
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,309
This is great.

84
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:51,462
If Chad becomes a doctor,

85
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:56,376
we can ask him to care for us when we are sick.

86
00:06:57,362 --> 00:06:59,574
You won’t fall ill easily. Trust me.

87
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:00,674
No one knows what the future holds.

88
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:04,364
Som.

89
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:06,506
What, Dad?

90
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,700
About your college plan? You haven’t answered me yet.

91
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:13,262
I haven’t thought about it yet.

92
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:15,336
I’m still exploring my options.

93
00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:17,060
I still have time.

94
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:21,703
Don’t spend your time playing around.

95
00:07:22,143 --> 00:07:25,386
If you fall behind your friends, don’t ask for my help.

96
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,608
I’ll apply for college in 12th grade.

97
00:07:27,842 --> 00:07:28,780
There’s no need to hurry.

98
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:31,351
I warn you out of good intentions.

99
00:07:31,545 --> 00:07:36,808
Your dad and I can’t help you make the decision because this is your future.

100
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:39,268
Look at Chad for an example.

101
00:07:40,983 --> 00:07:41,706
That’s right.

102
00:07:44,274 --> 00:07:45,438
Dad, why are you standing here?

103
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:47,949
I want to know what you want to study in college.

104
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:50,265
I lose my appetite because you are standing here.

105
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:52,265
Alright. Let’s leave her alone.

106
00:07:56,668 --> 00:07:59,515
(See? The day has just begun yet I’m already exhausted.)

107
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:03,856
Chad.

108
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,389
Chadjen, wait up.

109
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,568
Do you really want to be a doctor?

110
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:11,312
Wait.

111
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:15,259
When did you know that you wanted to go to a med school?

112
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:16,714
Why have I never known it before?

113
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:20,411
How did you know what you want to study? Please tell me.

114
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,914
Hey.

115
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,404
Why can’t you tell me?

116
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:32,801
Chadjen, wait for me.

117
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:33,617
Chadjen.

118
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:35,416
Chad.

119
00:08:42,671 --> 00:08:43,420
What are you eating?

120
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:45,736
Khao.

121
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:47,971
You scared me.

122
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,570
You were scared because of this?

123
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:01,671
I’m sorry.

124
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,746
Calm down.

125
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:06,712
Alright.

126
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:11,026
Are you secretly eating snacks?

127
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:13,607
I won’t steal it from you.

128
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:16,405
I…

129
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:19,308
I thought you were Tao.

130
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,179
He often steals my food.

131
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,019
If I knew it was you, I would share it with you.

132
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,247
Here.

133
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:32,911
It’s very tasty.

134
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:38,537
No, it’s not.

135
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:49,611
What’s wrong, New?

136
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,109
Who are you looking for?

137
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:53,306
I’m looking for Khao.

138
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:55,908
Does any of you know where she is?

139
00:09:56,973 --> 00:09:59,259
How would we know? We are sitting here with you.

140
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,650
If you’re not going to help, there’s no need to tick me off.

141
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:06,630
I just answered your question. I didn’t try to tick you off.

142
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,360
Guys, can you stop bickering for one day?

143
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:16,708
Nerd, did you finish the chemistry homework?

144
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:19,653
What?

145
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:22,648
You act like you finished it.

146
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,776
I haven’t finished it.

147
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,051
Can I copy yours?

148
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:28,059
Oh.

149
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:32,211
I thought I would ask Khao and New to help me do it.

150
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,662
Where is Khao?

151
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,074
Chadjen.

152
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:50,321
Did you finish the chemistry homework?

153
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:56,985
Take it if you want.

154
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:59,004
I am just asking.

155
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,903
I’ll return it when I’m done.

156
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:10,736
Nerd, didn’t you ask for Khao as rice?

157
00:11:11,746 --> 00:11:14,177
Tao, this is not the Khao that I was looking for.

158
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:14,943
Then what Khao?

159
00:11:15,656 --> 00:11:16,835
I already have this Khao.

160
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,137
Enjoy your meal.

161
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:22,441
Hello, everyone.

162
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,299
This is Mhog.

163
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:34,256
He asked me to use my class to select the cast for the school’s play.

164
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:43,282
This year, we will play Phra Aphai Mani – The Escape from Nang Phisuea Samudra.

165
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:46,927
Again?

166
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:50,060
This year, we will do things differently.

167
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,057
I promise.

168
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,980
You will get extra points for your admission portfolio.

169
00:11:57,137 --> 00:11:58,903
Does anyone want to get extra points?

170
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:02,257
Let’s begin.

171
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,709
The first role is the mermaid.

172
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:06,610
Please raise your hand if you want to play the role.

173
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,105
You.

174
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:16,539
Yes, you.

175
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:18,216
Please come out in front of the class.

176
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,780
Please give her a round of applause.

177
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:30,219
Next, the leading male role.

178
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:33,674
Who wants to play Phra Aphao Mani?

179
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,265
My friend over here.

180
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:37,537
Wait.

181
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,915
Gewalin, are you a boy?

182
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:41,074
Why did you raise your hand?

183
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,417
My friend wants to do it.

184
00:12:46,336 --> 00:12:48,903
Sassawat? You are an interesting choice.

185
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,457
Can you take off your glasses when you are on stage?

186
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,305
I can’t see without them.

187
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,536
That’s too bad.

188
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:56,640
Who else can play it?

189
00:12:58,256 --> 00:13:01,911
Chadjen, I think you are perfect to play Phra Aphai Mani.

190
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:03,911
Please give him a round of applause.

191
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,367
Excellent choice.

192
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:15,690
We have another main role that is very important to the story.

193
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,608
Who wants to play Nang Phisuea Samudra?

194
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:29,576
Is Nang Phisuea Samudra the ogress who transforms into a beautiful woman to compete with the mermaid?

195
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:33,577
Yes. She is prettier than the mermaid. That’s why Phra Aphai Mani falls for her.

196
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:40,951
I’ll do it.

197
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,841
That’s great, Gewalin.

198
00:13:44,038 --> 00:13:44,937
Come out here.

199
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:46,311
Give her a round of applause.

200
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,404
Sin Samudr.

201
00:13:57,605 --> 00:14:00,065
Sassawat, I think you can play Sin Samudr.

202
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,517
You can wear your glasses.

203
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,140
Come out. Please give him a round of applause.

204
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,134
Come on.

205
00:14:05,623 --> 00:14:07,000
You play the leading man’s son.

206
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:14,191
I’m sure that this play will be fun.

207
00:14:14,558 --> 00:14:16,579
Yeah!

208
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:24,013
I’m curious.

209
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:27,001
Why did no one want to play Nang Phisuea Samudra?

210
00:14:29,152 --> 00:14:30,099
Do you really not know why?

211
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:37,868
Tao said when she transforms into a woman, she is prettier than the mermaid.

212
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,379
Phra Aphai Mani falls for her beauty.

213
00:14:42,912 --> 00:14:45,802
That’s true, but she stays in the transformation for only a short while.

214
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:48,057
The scene is not included in the play.

215
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:50,816
Then what is the play about?

216
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,660
Do you really not know?

217
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:03,697
The play portrays the story when the mermaid helps Phra Aphai Mani and Sin Samudr run away from the ogress.

218
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:08,202
After they run away for seven days, the ogress finds out.

219
00:15:08,256 --> 00:15:11,134
She is furious and comes after him.

220
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:14,000
She comes after him as a beautiful woman, right?

221
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,505
No.

222
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:20,336
She comes after him as a ruthless ogress.

223
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:22,205
She eats the old mermaid.

224
00:15:23,244 --> 00:15:25,502
Am I playing a heartless character?

225
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,742
Yes.

226
00:15:28,044 --> 00:15:29,765
Boo! Do I look scary?

227
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:37,417
I didn’t carefully read the script.

228
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:40,099
I didn’t know that I wasn’t right for the role.

229
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:43,257
You still can withdraw from the play.

230
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:48,308
From what you tell me, the story is boring.

231
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:52,508
I want to do something new.

232
00:15:55,094 --> 00:15:56,714
Phra Aphai Mani plays a flute in the story, right?

233
00:15:57,398 --> 00:15:58,020
Yes.

234
00:15:58,444 --> 00:15:59,517
Do you know how to play it?

235
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:00,899
No.

236
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:03,208
See? You are not into the character.

237
00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:06,998
Why don’t we change him to be a rockstar?

238
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:09,299
Phra Aphai Mani plays a guitar.

239
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:14,619
Is it a good idea?

240
00:16:16,037 --> 00:16:18,011
I’ll propose the idea to Mr. Pong and Mhog tomorrow.

241
00:16:23,142 --> 00:16:24,300
How did she come up with the idea?

242
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,977
(I have an idea.)

243
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,130
(No.)

244
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,130
(No? It’s not a good time to chat with you?)

245
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,010
(No, I’m watching a series)

246
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,530
(Huh? You are watching a series? Thai or Chinese series?)

247
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:25,370
(I watch everything. I need to learn about acting. I want to play the leading lady well.)

248
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,930
(Yack! The leading lady.)

249
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:36,690
(Haha. I’ll talk to you tomorrow, Som. Bye.)

250
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,694
How did he forget his medicine?

251
00:17:42,008 --> 00:17:42,610
Hello.

252
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:43,940
How can I help you?

253
00:17:44,136 --> 00:17:46,840
I’m here to give my son his medicine.

254
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:47,829
Can I go into the school?

255
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:48,823
Here is his medicine.

256
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:51,506
You can’t go in. It’s the rule.

257
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:54,259
Can you call your son to come out and get it?

258
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,346
I could call him, I would have done it.

259
00:17:56,428 --> 00:17:58,651
I forgot my phone.

260
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:01,847
I just need to give this to my son. Can’t I go in?

261
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:02,813
No, you can’t.

262
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:04,085
It won’t take long.

263
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,108
Visitors are not allowed to go into the school.

264
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:08,908
Really? I’m not going to do anything.

265
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:11,114
I’m just giving this to my son.

266
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:14,300
- Hello, Uncle.
- Hello.

267
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,660
Do you need any help?

268
00:18:16,837 --> 00:18:20,656
Do you know New Sassawat, Grade 11 Class 2?

269
00:18:21,102 --> 00:18:22,697
Yes, I’m in the same class.

270
00:18:22,826 --> 00:18:23,487
Really?

271
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:24,724
You know him?

272
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:25,337
Yes.

273
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:26,401
Okay.

274
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:27,460
Thank you.

275
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:30,139
I’m New’s Dad.

276
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,921
Can you give the medicine to him?

277
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:35,561
If he doesn’t take the medicine, he will be in trouble.

278
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:37,905
I’m glad that I met you.

279
00:18:38,438 --> 00:18:40,724
Sure, Uncle. I’ll give it to him.

280
00:18:41,474 --> 00:18:42,481
Thanks a lot.

281
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:45,339
Don’t call me, Uncle. You can call me New’s Dad.

282
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:46,786
I feel old when you call me Uncle.

283
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:49,357
Yes, Uncle.

284
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,980
No, New’s Dad.

285
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,379
That’s good.

286
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,090
Excuse me.

287
00:18:55,105 --> 00:18:56,380
- Sure.
- Goodbye.

288
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,422
Thanks a lot.

289
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,214
Hello.

290
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:08,361
Do you see New?

291
00:19:42,577 --> 00:19:43,183
New.

292
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:45,108
Why are you sitting on the floor?

293
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:46,197
Khao.

294
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:49,023
It’s comfortable.

295
00:19:51,447 --> 00:19:52,085
Here.

296
00:19:52,711 --> 00:19:53,903
Your dad asked me to give it to you.

297
00:19:57,035 --> 00:19:57,820
Thank you.

298
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:00,811
Are you sick?

299
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:02,508
Is it serious?

300
00:20:04,865 --> 00:20:07,191
I…

301
00:20:13,414 --> 00:20:14,217
I found it.

302
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:17,111
Nerd, what are you doing here?

303
00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:21,112
This book makes it easier to understand the story.

304
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:24,407
If I read the original epic poem in the textbook, I wouldn’t get it.

305
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,111
I’m lucky that I have swimming practice.

306
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:30,143
If I had to do the play, it would be such a headache.

307
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:33,577
You are good at swimming. You should play the old mermaid.

308
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:34,755
No.

309
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:37,490
I don’t want to be eaten by the ogress.

310
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,109
Why does the senior have to run the play?

311
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:47,405
He treats us like kids.

312
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:49,214
Nerd, what’s going on?

313
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,306
You don’t seem to like Mhog.

314
00:20:52,228 --> 00:20:53,911
He hasn’t done anything to you.

315
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:57,614
He seems like a poser.

316
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,114
I don’t like him.

317
00:21:00,112 --> 00:21:01,207
You don’t like a poser.

318
00:21:02,474 --> 00:21:04,202
I guess you don’t like him too.

319
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,445
Look at him. He’s still acting like a poser.

320
00:21:14,136 --> 00:21:16,020
Can you add yellow paint to it?

321
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,164
I don’t think it looks good.

322
00:21:18,368 --> 00:21:18,971
Where?

323
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:20,112
Right there.

324
00:21:20,127 --> 00:21:21,016
You think so?

325
00:21:22,128 --> 00:21:23,167
Khao.

326
00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:25,210
Did you have dinner?

327
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:27,921
Yes. I hurriedly had it and came to see you.

328
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,134
I don’t want to keep you waiting.

329
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:30,805
Next time, you can take your time.

330
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,708
I don’t mind waiting.

331
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:33,708
Shall we start?

332
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:34,622
Yes.

333
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,462
Khao, please stand over there.

334
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:39,862
You can do it.

335
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:51,020
The mermaid says

336
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,730
that is the Magic Crystal Island.

337
00:21:56,582 --> 00:22:00,508
When he hears that, his worry is relieved.

338
00:22:01,205 --> 00:22:04,900
He says they seem to successfully escape.

339
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:10,826
Good job, Khao.

340
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:12,893
You remember your lines in a short time.

341
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:19,657
Guys, let’s call it off for today.

342
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:21,705
I need to talk to her.

343
00:22:23,998 --> 00:22:24,616
See you.

344
00:22:31,734 --> 00:22:34,619
You did great.

345
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:35,862
Sit down.

346
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,305
I don’t think I said my lines smoothly.

347
00:22:45,094 --> 00:22:45,900
No.

348
00:22:46,112 --> 00:22:48,945
If that were true, why would they give you a big round of applause?

349
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:52,506
I don’t feel confident.

350
00:22:52,874 --> 00:22:54,573
I never did a play before.

351
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:58,828
Mhog, can I ask you something?

352
00:22:59,032 --> 00:23:00,097
Sure.

353
00:23:01,402 --> 00:23:02,860
Why did you choose me?

354
00:23:03,527 --> 00:23:05,860
I think Lily can play the role well.

355
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,604
She got a top score in the Thai language exam.

356
00:23:11,748 --> 00:23:14,120
I need someone who is not only good at the Thai language.

357
00:23:14,774 --> 00:23:17,333
The mermaid is gentle but strong.

358
00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:21,358
I think that’s your personality.

359
00:23:23,477 --> 00:23:24,777
You think so?

360
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:29,628
You are tender-hearted but resilient.

361
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:31,011
I can tell.

362
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:35,725
I’m sorry.

363
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,939
Please think of me as your big brother.

364
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:50,223
Everyone, I’ll let the cast share their interpretation of their characters.

365
00:23:50,374 --> 00:23:52,659
I want you to pay attention to them.

366
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:56,300
If you have other ideas, feel free to tell me.

367
00:23:56,863 --> 00:23:58,302
Okay? Let’s give them a round of applause.

368
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:07,860
Why don’t we reinterpret Phra Aphai Mani?

369
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,539
Instead of playing flute, let’s change to a guitar.

370
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:14,505
In the scene where he teaches Sin Samudr how to play the flute, he teaches guitar instead.

371
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,671
What do you think about her idea?

372
00:24:17,817 --> 00:24:19,222
It’s a great idea.

373
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:20,490
Please give her a round of applause.

374
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,355
Please continue.

375
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:27,909
For the mermaid, let’s change her to be more bright and friendly.

376
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:36,914
We will change the image of Nang Phisuea Samudra.

377
00:24:37,557 --> 00:24:41,410
She is no longer a mean ogress. She will be a petite pretty giant.

378
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:49,300
I think the new interpretation is too far from the original character.

379
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,388
I agree with Lily.

380
00:24:53,968 --> 00:24:56,602
Then the play will no longer need to be called “Phra Aphai Mani”.

381
00:24:57,115 --> 00:25:00,635
That’s right.

382
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:02,703
Gewalin.

383
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,303
You are full of creativity.

384
00:25:05,826 --> 00:25:07,019
I’ve been teaching for ten years,

385
00:25:07,315 --> 00:25:10,506
this is the first time I have met a student who wants to reinterpret the story.

386
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:12,506
Mhog, what do you think?

387
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:15,311
If we don’t give it a try, we will never know.

388
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:17,074
We keep doing the same thing every year.

389
00:25:17,762 --> 00:25:19,105
It’s not a bad idea to try something new this year.

390
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,419
That’s right.

391
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,863
The original version is boring.

392
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,205
Normally, no one wants to watch the play anyway.

393
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,407
That’s right.

394
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:35,605
If you don’t come to watch it, no one would care.

395
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,400
This is also true.

396
00:25:39,432 --> 00:25:41,608
Okay. Please be quiet.

397
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:42,835
Let’s do it.

398
00:25:43,035 --> 00:25:44,674
If Mhog is okay with it, I have no problem.

399
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,011
But there’s one thing bothering me.

400
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:53,868
Nang Phisuea Samudra is a signature character.

401
00:25:54,131 --> 00:25:55,509
I think we need to keep her look as an ogress.

402
00:25:56,308 --> 00:25:58,851
Oh, the ogress.

403
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:02,011
That’s good. I think that’s the right choice.

404
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,011
I totally agree with you.

405
00:26:21,435 --> 00:26:22,706
What are we here, Khao?

406
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:25,508
I have a favor to ask you.

407
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,097
Can you collect the classroom’s common funds from our classmates?

408
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:31,722
But you are the treasurer.

409
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,973
You reinterpret the mermaid. I need to practice it.

410
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:36,866
Alright.

411
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:38,271
I’ll help you.

412
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:39,957
Khao.

413
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:43,105
I never collected money from anyone.

414
00:26:43,219 --> 00:26:44,976
What if I can’t collect from all of them?

415
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,367
It’s not that hard.

416
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:49,968
I’ll train you how to do it.

417
00:26:56,391 --> 00:26:58,414
Kuayjeng, Grade 11 Class 2.

418
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:01,614
I need to talk to you.

419
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:04,557
What the heck are you doing?

420
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:07,200
The fee for the common funds, 100 baht.

421
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,967
When are you going to pay it?

422
00:27:09,117 --> 00:27:10,048
What common funds?

423
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,777
I don’t have it. I won’t pay it. I won’t avoid you.

424
00:27:15,238 --> 00:27:16,607
I’m not a part of the play.

425
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,909
Why do I need to pay it?

426
00:27:20,865 --> 00:27:21,909
Are you going to pay it or not?

427
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:23,497
No.

428
00:27:23,638 --> 00:27:24,638
I’ll ask you one more time.

429
00:27:24,653 --> 00:27:25,540
Will you pay it?

430
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:36,918
Here.

431
00:27:37,868 --> 00:27:38,918
Moneygrubber.

432
00:27:39,948 --> 00:27:40,785
That’s all.

433
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,617
Do we need to be this tough on him?

434
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:46,103
Yes.

435
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:47,517
He’s the hardest one.

436
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:49,201
The rest is a piece of cake.

437
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,760
You can do it. Trust me.

438
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,410
I can do it.

439
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:01,552
He’s cute.

440
00:28:01,737 --> 00:28:02,352
Which one?

441
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:03,574
That one.

442
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,976
The three girls, when are you going to pay the fee?

443
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,001
I have asked you several times.

444
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,287
You are the class president.

445
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,755
If our classmates find out you are acting like this, that won’t look good.

446
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,757
Now, you have a maid.

447
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,260
Oops, you have an assistant, Khao?

448
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,608
Right. We agreed to pay it because of Khao.

449
00:28:40,961 --> 00:28:44,795
We actually paid it for the sake of Chadjen, Lily’s man.

450
00:28:44,804 --> 00:28:46,468
Nice saying.

451
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:48,149
Right.

452
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:48,961
Som.

453
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,063
Khao, don’t do it.

454
00:29:00,595 --> 00:29:02,779
My hands are just a bit stiff. It’s nothing.

455
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,305
What the heck?

456
00:29:09,825 --> 00:29:12,010
Som, can you collect the money from the other classmates?

457
00:29:12,469 --> 00:29:13,777
I took all the tough ones down.

458
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:15,274
The rest is a piece of cake.

459
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,025
Thanks.

460
00:29:21,937 --> 00:29:24,254
See? I told you. You look good with a guitar.

461
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:27,579
The costume looks good on you.

462
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,106
You are perfect for the role of the ogress.

463
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,991
When you play the guitar.

464
00:29:36,414 --> 00:29:39,405
Khao, let’s rehearse on stage.

465
00:29:40,137 --> 00:29:43,170
If I see something off, we will work on it later.

466
00:29:45,623 --> 00:29:46,539
Sure, Mhog.

467
00:29:48,214 --> 00:29:48,967
Go for it.

468
00:29:50,343 --> 00:29:51,031
Go for it.

469
00:29:52,281 --> 00:29:53,103
Let me help you.

470
00:29:57,891 --> 00:29:58,616
You can do it.

471
00:30:06,111 --> 00:30:07,456
New is working hard for his role.

472
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,946
His acting is pretty good.

473
00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:16,228
Guys.

474
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:18,574
Let’s go have lunch.

475
00:30:35,428 --> 00:30:37,250
Khao, Khao, Khao, Khao.

476
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,226
We have a huge problem.

477
00:30:38,494 --> 00:30:39,139
What?

478
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,016
I lost the common fund pouch.

479
00:30:43,647 --> 00:30:46,416
Huh? You lost the common fund pouch?

480
00:30:48,902 --> 00:30:50,380
Don’t panic yet.

481
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,702
Let’s help me find it first.

482
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,608
What are we going to do? That’s a lot of money.

483
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:56,402
How can we find money to pay it back?

484
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,712
Come on, Khao. Please help me find it.

485
00:30:59,979 --> 00:31:02,405
Som, do you need my help?

486
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:04,540
No. Let’s go, Khao.

487
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:08,909
Where is it?

488
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:12,976
Chad.

489
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:16,069
Are you going to help Som find it?

490
00:31:17,613 --> 00:31:20,531
Nothing? How can you do nothing about it?

491
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,099
Braised trotter? It’s my favorite.

492
00:31:37,115 --> 00:31:39,100
Right. This is also tasty.

493
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:45,422
I recently lost some weight.

494
00:31:46,425 --> 00:31:47,376
I can eat it now.

495
00:31:48,634 --> 00:31:49,339
Som.

496
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:50,114
Hello, Dad.

497
00:31:50,124 --> 00:31:51,096
Hello, Mom.

498
00:31:53,056 --> 00:31:54,573
Let’s have dinner.

499
00:31:54,585 --> 00:31:56,408
Then you can take a shower and go to bed.

500
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,805
I don’t want to eat it. I lost my appetite.

501
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:05,111
Chad, what’s wrong with her?

502
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,379
Did someone break your heart?

503
00:32:15,628 --> 00:32:17,508
She is just tired from rehearsing the play.

504
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,511
Did I accidentally throw it into a trashcan?

505
00:32:33,088 --> 00:32:35,534
Did someone steal it when I left my bag in front of the faculty room?

506
00:32:38,896 --> 00:32:40,782
Did I leave it in the toilet?

507
00:32:41,474 --> 00:32:44,620
Why does it seem like it could be anywhere?

508
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,057
What’s wrong?

509
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:51,417
Tell me so I can help you.

510
00:32:54,794 --> 00:32:56,005
Are you going to help me?

511
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:01,100
Mom.

512
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,186
Dad.

513
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:05,217
I…

514
00:33:12,051 --> 00:33:13,422
I lost my classroom’s common fund.

515
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,517
What?

516
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:17,223
You are so careless

517
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:18,616
How much is it?

518
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:23,777
It’s almost 4,000 baht.

519
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,514
4,000 baht?

520
00:33:26,681 --> 00:33:27,945
Did you try to find it?

521
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,008
Didn’t you say you’re going to help me?

522
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:33,899
That’s a lot of money.

523
00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:36,022
How did you lose it?

524
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,115
Go talk to your dad.

525
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:42,505
Borrow the money from him to pay it back.

526
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:45,908
How about this?

527
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,962
Why don’t you look for it again?

528
00:33:48,451 --> 00:33:50,408
Ask Chadjen to help you look for it.

529
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,408
You still have some time to look for it.

530
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:54,965
Can’t you help her?

531
00:33:55,638 --> 00:33:57,586
It’s not that I can’t help her.

532
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:00,219
But I don’t want to lend her the help too easily.

533
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,002
It’s not time to think about that.

534
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,334
Don’t you see that she is stressed out?

535
00:34:03,448 --> 00:34:04,517
She needs to…

536
00:34:04,527 --> 00:34:06,863
Mom, Dad, please stop arguing.

537
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,711
It’s my fault. I’ll take responsibility for it.

538
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:14,309
- How will you find the money to pay it back?
-How will you find the money to pay it back?

539
00:34:17,201 --> 00:34:18,905
I don’t think it’s gone.

540
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:21,610
It’s probably at the school.

541
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:24,911
I’m confident that I can find it.

542
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:34,702
Where can I find it?

543
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,213
Did you have your medicine?

544
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:45,663
Don’t forget to take it.

545
00:34:46,124 --> 00:34:47,856
Yes, I have it. I got it.

546
00:34:48,096 --> 00:34:51,361
New, do you have your friend’s number?

547
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,509
Give it to me.

548
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:55,936
If there’s an emergency or you forget to take the medicine, I will call them.

549
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:57,936
You can call me.

550
00:34:58,077 --> 00:35:00,308
Last time, you were the one who forgot your phone.

551
00:35:01,311 --> 00:35:02,386
Did you just nag me?

552
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:06,542
Give me the number of the girl who took the medicine to you.

553
00:35:08,537 --> 00:35:09,831
It’s okay, Dad.

554
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:12,220
Next time, just leave it with the security.

555
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:14,745
If I forget to bring it, I’ll go ask the security.

556
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:17,724
I had an argument with the security.

557
00:35:18,225 --> 00:35:19,641
Why did you argue with him?

558
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:22,760
Fine. Kids these days are so stubborn.

559
00:35:23,056 --> 00:35:23,736
Go.

560
00:35:23,902 --> 00:35:24,601
I got to go.

561
00:35:24,614 --> 00:35:25,288
Good luck.

562
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,121
Goodbye, Dad.

563
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:26,988
Don’t forget to take your medicine.

564
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,171
Got it.

565
00:35:30,451 --> 00:35:31,462
Drive safely.

566
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:39,905
Did you forget your medicine today?

567
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:41,703
No.

568
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,457
Wait.

569
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:48,029
Are you sick?

570
00:35:48,087 --> 00:35:50,936
I’m sorry, Khao. I need to go get dressed for the play.

571
00:35:51,053 --> 00:35:51,703
Excuse me.

572
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:02,305
You are working hard.

573
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,817
You did well.

574
00:36:07,496 --> 00:36:08,257
Who is that?

575
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:19,921
Som.

576
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,751
I’m sorry.

577
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,912
I can’t find the pouch.

578
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:33,662
But I can lend you some money.

579
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:37,180
When the play is over, we can go look for the pouch again.

580
00:36:37,219 --> 00:36:37,900
Okay?

581
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,223
But it’s a lot of money, Tao.

582
00:36:40,786 --> 00:36:42,223
How much is it?

583
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:44,825
4,000 baht.

584
00:36:48,955 --> 00:36:49,859
4,000 baht?

585
00:36:52,905 --> 00:36:56,514
If I can’t find it, I’ll borrow money from my parent to pay it back.

586
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:58,514
Thanks a lot, Tao.

587
00:37:04,357 --> 00:37:05,204
How did it get here?

588
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,222
- What, Som? - I was looking for it everywhere yesterday.

589
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:12,777
I’ll go tell Khao.

590
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,007
Follow me this way.

591
00:37:36,762 --> 00:37:41,613
Father. Mother, where should we go?

592
00:37:42,862 --> 00:37:43,965
Honey, don’t worry.

593
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,210
If the ogress comes, I’ll protect you with the guitar.

594
00:37:49,508 --> 00:37:53,509
Let’s go that way. I think we will be safe. Let’s go.

595
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,185
Follow me.

596
00:37:55,675 --> 00:37:58,108
Sin Samudr, don’t steal the mermaid from your father.

597
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:02,552
No.

598
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:12,002
Follow me.

599
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:26,905
Father. Mother. I’m so tired.

600
00:38:27,419 --> 00:38:29,262
When will we escape from the ogress?

601
00:38:30,237 --> 00:38:31,331
How would I know?

602
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:34,380
But you can’t give up.

603
00:38:34,404 --> 00:38:37,000
If you don’t give up, we can surely escape from her.

604
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:37,715
Let’s go, honey.

605
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,240
The ogress is here.

606
00:38:57,682 --> 00:38:58,607
Where are you?

607
00:38:59,613 --> 00:39:01,216
Where are they?

608
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:05,010
Do you think you can run away from me?

609
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,205
If I find you, I’ll eat you up.

610
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,019
Where are you?

611
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:18,062
Come out, both the father and the son.

612
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,417
Do you think you can run away from me?

613
00:39:29,195 --> 00:39:30,300
Where are you?

614
00:39:42,903 --> 00:39:44,020
Calm down.

615
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,122
We can’t run away from her.

616
00:39:46,462 --> 00:39:47,511
What should we do?

617
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:51,754
I think we should go that way. It’s probably safer.

618
00:39:52,551 --> 00:39:53,202
Let’s go.

619
00:39:56,814 --> 00:39:57,564
You guys.

620
00:39:58,373 --> 00:39:59,564
Come back with me.

621
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:01,800
Stop it.

622
00:40:07,257 --> 00:40:08,017
I’ll handle it.

623
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,082
You are dead!

624
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:38,285
Run away.

625
00:40:49,602 --> 00:40:51,041
You are dead.

626
00:40:51,223 --> 00:40:52,632
Stop right there.

627
00:40:57,804 --> 00:40:59,914
The ogress destroys the set.

628
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,106
Stop filming.

629
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,878
Stop filming.

630
00:41:06,669 --> 00:41:07,416
Stop filming.

631
00:41:08,011 --> 00:41:08,708
Som-O.

632
00:41:10,149 --> 00:41:10,906
Are you okay?

633
00:41:13,678 --> 00:41:14,807
Are you injured?

634
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:17,660
Som, are you alright?

635
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,743
Mother, are you okay?

636
00:41:22,419 --> 00:41:23,706
You still can play a joke?

637
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,115
Stop filming.

638
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,976
Stop filming.

639
00:41:34,168 --> 00:41:34,970
Som-O.

640
00:41:36,991 --> 00:41:37,875
Are you alright?

641
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,561
Chad.

642
00:42:20,628 --> 00:42:21,708
I’m sorry.

643
00:42:24,782 --> 00:42:29,008
Saying sorry won’t change anything.

644
00:42:34,637 --> 00:42:35,613
Get up and go home.

645
00:43:08,745 --> 00:43:10,653
How could you say such a terrible thing to Som?

646
00:43:11,285 --> 00:43:12,660
She’s feeling bad enough.

647
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,641
It was her fault. You saw it.

648
00:43:17,337 --> 00:43:19,025
It was an accident. You saw it.

649
00:43:20,493 --> 00:43:23,740
If you want to comfort her. Then do it.

650
00:43:24,921 --> 00:43:26,616
Do you like to be a villain?

651
00:43:27,845 --> 00:43:28,410
Huh?

652
00:43:30,637 --> 00:43:34,611
You are the one who found the pouch for her?

653
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,761
Som-O.

654
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:22,568
Let’s go.

655
00:44:23,408 --> 00:44:24,010
Wait.

656
00:44:25,533 --> 00:44:26,616
Your bag is not zipped up.

657
00:44:26,874 --> 00:44:27,654
Really?

658
00:44:27,788 --> 00:44:28,413
It’s okay.

659
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:29,813
I’ll do it.

660
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:36,964
Are you done? I want to go to school to find the pouch.

661
00:44:39,355 --> 00:44:40,010
Done.

662
00:44:41,297 --> 00:44:42,010
You can go now.

663
00:44:58,078 --> 00:44:59,118
Mr. Pong.

664
00:45:01,122 --> 00:45:03,096
This is the common fund of Grade 11 Class 2.

665
00:45:03,361 --> 00:45:06,205
Your account record is very detailed.

666
00:45:06,234 --> 00:45:07,411
Thank you, Kwanta.

667
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:14,217
Khao.

668
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:19,174
What?

669
00:45:21,407 --> 00:45:22,762
Can I talk to you?

670
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:23,752
Yes.

671
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,205
What?

672
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,878
You want me to say it here?

673
00:45:33,038 --> 00:45:34,309
Yes, here.

674
00:45:37,245 --> 00:45:38,309
I…

675
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,718
I don’t like…

676
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,699
I don’t like that Mhog is being around you.

677
00:45:59,343 --> 00:46:02,506
Chadjen, when Som-O is mad at you, how do you make up with her?

678
00:46:05,374 --> 00:46:06,112
Bye, Som.

679
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,358
Ride safely.

680
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,602
Yeah, we are going to Phuket.

681
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:14,742
I’m going to have a romantic trip with your mom.

682
00:46:15,165 --> 00:46:17,146
You are staying home.

683
00:46:17,168 --> 00:46:19,253
Chadjen, please come to check on Som-O often.

684
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:19,937
Sure.

685
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,822
One day, I’ll amaze everyone that I am the coolest and the best.

686
00:46:25,189 --> 00:46:26,044
And the prettiest.

687
00:46:28,247 --> 00:46:29,240
Why didn’t you answer my call?

688
00:46:29,259 --> 00:46:31,207
Didn’t you say you were on an overseas trip with your family?

689
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:32,379
This is not funny.

690
00:46:33,905 --> 00:46:35,514
Som, this is for you.

691
00:46:36,321 --> 00:46:37,014
For me?

692
00:46:37,145 --> 00:46:37,801
Yes.

693
00:46:41,645 --> 00:46:43,637
Happy New Year.

694
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:45,711
You know how to read palms?

695
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,813
When you put your hands together, you will see the half moon on your palms.

696
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:56,011
It means you are grounded, honest, and faithful.

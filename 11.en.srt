are like this if you lift it like this.

185
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,410
Noona, let's eat.

186
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,810
Yes, that should work. That should work, but...

187
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,300
if you do it this way instead,

188
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,230
it's much easier to do.

189
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,220
Who are you?

190
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,150
I have never seen it again since I delivered it to him that day!

191
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,440
Geez! How frustrating.

192
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,890
Calm down.

193
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,340
Hey, calm down.

194
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,130

00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:47,150

[Shin Yoon Bok]

197
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,510
How is the Teacher doing?

198
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,750
See her yourself.

199
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,480
Right.

200
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,910
You might want to hold your breath for a moment.

201
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,280
I'll open the door.

202
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,170
T-Teacher?

203
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,740
I heard protein helps you recover from a concussion.

204
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,340
Go ahead and eat.

205
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,700
Thank you, Yoon Bok.

206
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,960
W-What is wrong?

207
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,080
The beef is...

208
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,440
too tasty.

209
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,770
I don't have the right to eat something tasty.

210
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,920
W-What do you mean by that?

211
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,660
Everyone has the right to eat beef-

212
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,600
I couldn't save the plant, the popup event,

213
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,780
and I ruined Camille's image, too.

214
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,600
I couldn't even protect your dream of becoming a webtoon artist, either.

215
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,500
I wasn't able to protect anything.

216
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,490
- Pardon?
- Maybe...

217
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,850
my dream might be too ambitious for my ability.

218
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,460
I destroyed the mood just now, too, huh?

219
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,830
Didn't I?

220
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,010
Teacher, you know...

221
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,560
you saved me.

222
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,990
What?

223
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,120
I have been discouraged for a long time,

224
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:02,740
but you let me come out to the world and live. Did you forget?

225
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,210
You are capable of saving anything.

226
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,350
So, eat a lot and feel better.

227
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,890
Here you go.

228
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,640
It is hot. Take your time and eat slowly.

229
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,680
Thank you.

230
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,250
- It's tasty.
- It's hot.

231
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:49,140
Teacher, you know you saved me.

232
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,100
You are capable of saving anything.

[Fashion Show - Approve]

234
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,980
You already got all these?

235
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,670
My physical strength, heart, time,

236
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,800
talent, devotion, and social skills.

237
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,070
I used all of it to the max and got them.

238
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,530
I already know you worked very hard.

239
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,470
You're keeping your promise, right?

240
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,870
- There is just one thing.
- What is it now?

241
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:26,330
You probably know, but there was an incident recently.

The village is feeling uneasy.

00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,350
Are you saying no?

244
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:36,000
I am asking you to have tight security for the fashion show.

245
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,420
Good luck preparing for it.

246
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,390
Yes!

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,750
Thank you, Mr. Shin.

248
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,190
It probably wasn't an easy decision under the circumstances.

249
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,410
You worked hard trying to adjust to an unfamiliar environment.

250
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,140
It was really freaking hard.

251
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,990
But...

252
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,500
I got to think of you as I started adjusting.

253
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:11,200
I thought it must've been hard for you to adjust to living in Paris then.

254
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,510
I endured it...

255
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,180
because I had you then.

256
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,720
Really?

257
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,700
Tell me now, then.

258
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,960
Did you think of me at times...

259
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,470

260
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,630
Well, sometimes?

261
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,420
Every once in a while?

262

263

Sometimes, every once in a while?

264
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,870
It's all in the past. Why do you ask about it?

265
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,730
Just because...

266
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,120
How was your marriage, by the way?

267
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,620
She was a good person.

268
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,940
Although she was gone too soon.

269
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,100
I wonder what would've happened if we made a different decision then.

270
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,000
Would we have walked this path every day together?

271
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,190
We might have been walking down

272
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,750
Champs-Élysées together, too.

273
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,850
That would've been nice, too.

Well done, Camille.

Call Hong Do Kim right now and...

282
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,450
No, I'll call her myself.

283
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,530
Send me her address.

284
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,900
Ms. Camille.

285
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,990
Here.

286
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,310
What a cozy place.

287
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,580
Please have a seat here.

288
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,110
Okay.

289
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,040
How are you feeling?

290
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,540
I'm okay.

291
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,390
Then, come to work early tomorrow.

292
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,740
- Pardon?
- The fashion show.

293
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,490
It's happening.

294
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,620
Really? My gosh.

295
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:02,000
You know how much I suffered to make this happen, right?

296
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,270
So, you'd better show off your talent, okay?

297
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:13,050
This will be Camille's biggest challenge and change.

298
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:17,490
Let's combine Camille's craftsmanship and Korea's tradition

299
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:22,210
and create art that would excite the entire world.

300
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,520
You and me together.

301
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,560
Would I be able to do that?

302
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,400
I wonder if I'm tainting your image.

303
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,330
The pop-up event failed because of me, too.

304
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,710
Hong Do Kim.

305
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:48,570
How many times do you think I've been set back before I debuted?

306
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,980
How about after the debut?

307
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,980
How do you think it is now?

308
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,260
In every moment of life, endless setbacks

309
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,940
are awaiting you...

310
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,120
like a whole mountain range.

311
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,290
You'd continue to be set back, anyway.

312
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,630
It's up to you to decide if you'd collapse or get back up now.

313
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:22,030
If you'd collapse, I have no reason to be here.

314
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,670
Come and get it when you get back up.

315
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,530
Ms. Camille.

316
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,240
You know I can't wait long, right?

317
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,760
Your desk will be cleared after tomorrow.

318
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,330
Yes.

319
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,310
As Yoon Bok said,

320
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,040
I can save anything.

321
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,910
I'll revive the flame of passion that's dying in me first.

322
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,760
I'm not trying to abandon you.

323
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:28,640
I'm trying to free you and save you in a bigger and brighter world.

324
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:35,140
Because I'm reminded of myself whenever I see you.

325
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,250
So, let's be sure to survive together. Okay?

326
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,830
Got it?

327
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:53,890
The roots are deep and strong. It will not die.

328
00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:00,280
It will overcome this hardship and grow into a stronger tree.

329
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,720
Will it really?

330
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,330
Yes.

331
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:13,040
It will revive for sure if you water it and care for it every day.

332
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,150
So, do not get tired and cheer up, Teacher.

333
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,430
Okay.

334
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,520
Yoon Bok.

335
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,660
What's with the car?

336
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,960
Get in.

337
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,370
I will take you to work to celebrate your recovery.

338
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,170
Thank you.

339
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,550
Of course.

340
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,160
I will close the door.

341
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,050
I-I will turn right.

342
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,300
I-I will turn left.

343
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,200
A speed bump!

344
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,110
Teacher!

345
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,470
Teacher, a-are you okay? Your neck...

346
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,310
Let's go. I don't want to be late.

347
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,990
Okay.

348
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,160
Thank you for driving me.

349
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,710
Do not mention it.

350
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,160
Teacher!

351
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:32,010
A famous doctor in Mt. Jiri gathered this ginseng extract drop by drop.

352
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,620
Drink it up and cheer up today.

353
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:38,860
Gosh, thank you. You shouldn't have.

354
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,270
I will take that.

355
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:54,080
Bitterness needs to be chased by sweetness.

356
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,860
Gosh, what's going on here?

357
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,460
It smells.

358
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,180
But I took a shower.

359
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,830
Do I still smell?

360
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,550
It smells sweet.

361
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,190
Gosh, how sweet.

362
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,330
How sweet. So very sweet.

363
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,220
I'm lonely.

364
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,020
I'll get going.

365
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,450
Good luck today.

366
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,740
Bye.

367
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,660
I wanted you to hang a more flattering photo.

368
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,740
Thank you.

369
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,630
I look forward to seeing your design.

370
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,110
Yes, ma'am!

371
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:12,260
My daughter became so pretty.

372
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:17,030
Is Hong Hak doing well, too?

373
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,080
I miss them.

374
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:42,180
Where did he go?

375
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,130
[A man from the Joseon era. Shin Soo Geun, the leader of Seongsan Village, keeping tradition.]

376
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,190
[He left the village and lived in Paris for a year in his youth...]

377
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,560
That stuck-up old man left the village for a whole year.

378
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,840
What did he do in Paris, exactly?

379
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:31,300
Please look into what Shin Soo Geun did in Paris when he was young.

380
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,150
Young Master.

381
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,320
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

382
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,280
I am here to see you.

383
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,810
Me?

384
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:49,600
What is going on at this hour?

385
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,760
It is regarding Gamjjok.

386
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:58,650
I thought he only swapped out the cultural heritage with fakes,

387
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,070
but he swapped the culprit with a fake one, too.

388
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,290
But what does that have to do with me?

389
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,830
Because I think the real Gamjjok...

390
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,820
is here in Seongsan Hall.

391
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,760
You said it yourself.

392
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:24,620
That the deals have been made in Seongsan Hall all this time.

393
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:31,270
That is why I will be keeping my eyes peeled.

394
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,860
Look forward to it.

395
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:06,770
I think the real Gamjjok is here in Seongsan Hall.

396
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,980
Gosh, I'm stuck.

397
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,120
You ran away once.

398
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,350
How dare you come back to this place?

399
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,810
Why did I think of those lines just now?

400
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,410
This is why you need oxygen.

401
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,560
Aigoo.

402
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,990
That kid hasn't changed.

403
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,390
By the way, why won't Hong Do come out?

404
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,620
It's hard to see her face.

405
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,630
What?

406
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,190
Noona.

407
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,450
What's banana milk doing here?

408
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,440
By chance...

409
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,140
did my fan leave it here?

410
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,710
Gosh, I'm too popular.

411
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,800
Thank you!

412
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,600
Dad used to get this for me whenever we went to a bathhouse.

413
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,950
Hey, don't bring him up.

414
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,490
Don't you know he took everything and ran away to survive on his own?

415
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,260
Why won't you even let me speak?

416
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,760
I wonder if he's staying healthy.

417
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,450
What are you doing here?

418
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:05,810
What are you throwing away?

419
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:14,070
May I have a look?

420
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,530
What's wrong, Young Master?

421
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,630
I think I was mistaken.

422
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,380
I am sorry.

423
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:57,770
- Yes.
- I did what you told me to do.

424
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:45,040
He knew I would be following him.

425
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:50,750
I acted hastily and gave him the upper hand.

426
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:56,820
There's only circumstantial evidence.

427
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,580
It will be okay.

428
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,450
Hang in there, okay?

429
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:05,420
These bastards. I'll sue them for coercion.

430
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,370
Detective, they found evidence.

431
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,070
Really?

432
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,490
Over here, sir.

433
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:53,850
We found your vehicle and blunt weapon at your residence.

434
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:59,200
What are you talking about?

435
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,400
Blood was found on the blunt weapon that was used

436
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,260
and the DNA result will come out soon.

437
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,790
Stop dragging this out, and come clean. Okay?

438
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,600
I said it wasn't me!

439
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:31,290
All the circumstances are pointing at Joon Ho.

440
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:34,360
He is thorough enough to predict I would be following him,

441
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,800
but he must have missed something.

442
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:42,110
Let us walk through the case one more time.

443
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,420
Okay.

444
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:48,080
After your teacher got into the accident that day,

445
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,360
the fan was stolen and...

446
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,130
That's pretty.

447
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,720
It's pretty, but...

448
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,320
there's no story in the design.

449
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,550
Pardon?

450
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:08,280
Design without a story is like flat champagne.

451
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:13,930
Use the key chain's story and fix everything.

452
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:16,280
Okay. I'll give it another try.

453
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,820
I went to Seongsan Village and confirmed that the fan in the storage was fake.

454
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,060
That's when I arrived at Seongsan Hall

455
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:27,360
and saw the men who attempted to buy the fan run away.

456
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,380
What happened to the men who ran away?

457
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:36,590
The police chased them and saw them last in Chinatown in Incheon.

458
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:43,130
We can catch them and find out who they tried to make a deal with.

459
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:46,900
No, no. It still doesn't have a story.

460
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,100
It's no fun.

461
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,120
Redo it.

462
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,630
Okay.

463
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:06,790
Is this the best you can do?

464
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:10,800
Old, classic, romance.

465
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,550
Didn't you tell the press that that's the story of the key chain?

466
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:18,500
Get it together, Hong Do Kim!

467
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,810
I'll try it again.

468
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,690
Cheer up, Kim Hong Do.

469
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,870
Let's go!

470
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:06,850
I will go this way. You go that way.

471
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,220
Okay.

472
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:22,240
Try going that way this time.

473
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,660
Okay.

474
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,860
How did it go?

475
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,880
The roots are deep and strong. It will not die.

476
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:14,300
It will overcome this hardship and grow into a stronger tree.

477
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,230
Yoon Bok was right.

478
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,450
I will try again.

479
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:49,830
It's nice.

480
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,980
Pardon?

481
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,740
Make a sample using this.

482
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:57,850
Really? Did I pass?

483
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,660
Good luck.

484
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:04,150
This will be your debut work you won't forget until you die.

485
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:07,650
Thank you!

486
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:11,120
Start creating samples using this, Hong Do Kim.

487
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,730
Frankie, let's officially start promoting.

488
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:17,560
Contact the media companies and Hollywood celebrities.

489
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,150
Come up with a model list and hire the people we need.

490
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,040
Okay.

491
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,420
I searched through all the shopping centers,

492
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,800
but there was not even a trace.

493
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,940
You get caught if your tail is long.

494
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,220
If they noticed they were being chased,

495
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,630
they will make it more mysterious.

496
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,780
What should we do now?

497
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,460
We will expand our search in the area, focusing on the hotels tomorrow.

498
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,630
Okay.

499
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,790
- Hong Do Kim.
- Hello.

500
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:12,400
They will be assisting you with this fashion show.

501
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:15,200
Say hello.

502
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,030
Hello, I'm Moon Soo Hee.

503
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:21,110
I'm Ah Yeong. Nice to meet you.

504
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:24,360
I'm Kim Hong Do. I'm in your care.

505
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,940
I will never be rude to my assistants.

506
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,910
You're getting along so well already.

507
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:35,060
Start working now, then.

508
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,620
Shall we get started?

509
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,470
Have a seat. Have a seat.

510
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,050
Ah Yeong.

511
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,740
What happened to the document I requested earlier?

512
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,430
It's only been three hours since you asked.

513
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:13,060
You need it already?

514
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:17,720
It would've taken only an hour even if you took your time.

515
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:26,320
Listening to music makes me more productive.

516
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,360
I see.

517
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,280
Feel free to listen to it.

518
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,220
Instead, please get the document ready soon.

519
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,960
Okay, Sunbaenim.

520
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:56,630
Ah Yeong, did you get the fabric samples?

521
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,990
Pardon?

522
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:59,310
No.

523
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:02,930
You didn't give me the deadline.

524
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,710
I'll get them by tomorrow.

525
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:22,990
Did you want to see me?

526
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:28,940
Yes. I'd like to serve Korean food for the fashion show.

527
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:35,910
Should I contact Seongsan Hall since we worked with them last time?

528
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:40,260
Good. Meet with them today and get them to say yes.

529
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,800
Okay.

530
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,970
I don't know. I haven't seen him.

531
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:47,550
Sir.

532
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:50,410
I am desperately looking for my brother, whom I lost as a kid.

533
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:52,320
Please have another look.

534
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,190
Try the basement of the building next door.

535
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:59,000
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

536
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,550
Who are you?

537
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,630
I am looking for someone.

538
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:18,420
He's not here. Get out.

539
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,780
I said get out!

540
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,970
Shit...

541
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,020
Get out.

542
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,210
I'm sorry for making you come all the way here.

543
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,850
Not at all.

544
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:43,180
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

545
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,210
As I said over the phone,

546
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:53,500
we'd like Seongsan Hall to cater the fashion show.

547
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:58,590
We'll tell you the number of attendees as soon as we figure it out.

548
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:02,280
The menu is entirely up to you.

549
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,390
Sounds good.

550
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:07,380
I'll have a look and let you know.

551
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,280
Thank you.

552
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:16,240
By the way, what's your relationship with Young Master Yoon Bok?

553
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,420
Pardon?

554
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,350
You appeared close the last time I saw you.

555
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,100
Are you seeing each other?

556
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,230
Yes.

557
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,170
That's great.

558
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,660
- Excuse me for a second.
- Sure.

559
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:52,400
I have to take this call. I'll be right back.

560
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:13,210
What? Who came by?

561
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:18,220
Hey, you'd better stay put and hide in there.

562
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:30,710
It's Camille.

563
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,340
Why does he have so many Camille?

564
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:47,220
My gosh.

565
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:05,530
This is a rare, limited edition item.

566
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:12,960
Gosh, wow.

567
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,740
Daebak. My goodness.

568
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:18,510
Gosh.

569
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,510
How many Camille coats does he have?

570
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:53,480
[Epilogue]

571
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,300
How did it go?

572
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:16,680
[Dare to Love Me]

573
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,480
- Hong Do.
- Yes.

574
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,900
Did you see it, by chance?

575
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:23,690
Pardon?

576
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:27,800
You are trying to make a profit by scheming with this woman!

577
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,280
You will have to step down as the village leader, too.

578
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,990
Your Excellency Lee!

579
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,670
Master!

580
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:37,270
Where are you? Come to the second floor.

581
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,720
Check the second floor.

582
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,060
Are you crazy?

583
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:45,960
I told you I would make sure to catch the thief.

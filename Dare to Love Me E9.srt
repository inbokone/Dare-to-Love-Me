THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL
AND ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, GROUPS,

AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA
ARE HISTORICALLY IRRELEVANT.

3
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,382
ANIMALS WERE FILMED IN COMPLIANCE
WITH THE PRODUCTION GUIDELINES.

4
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,901
Yoon-bok.

5
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,395
Mom…

6
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,031
How have…

7
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,451
you and Mother been all this time?

8
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,583
We were in Seongsan Village all our lives.

9
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,502
So when we suddenly had to leave…

10
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,172
we had a hard time adjusting

11
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,467
and had no idea what to do.

12
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,473
We had a lot of difficult days.

13
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,935
However,

14
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,897
even in tough times,

15
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,025
Mom never once forgot about you.

16
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,410
On the day she was diagnosed
with terminal illness,

17
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,540
she cried holding onto your baby clothes.

18
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,335
Seeing that broke my heart.

19
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,591
I also cried my eyes out in secret.

20
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,183
To be honest,

21
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,437
I cried often as well.

22
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,235
You promised you would return
by the time I counted to <i>on</i>.

23
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,995
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

24
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,924
I missed you so much
that I only counted to 99

25
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,427
and did not count to <i>on</i>.

26
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,141
Therefore…

27
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,397
you kept your promise.

28
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,114
Yoon-bok.

29
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,726
{\an8}THE LATE PI HYE-WON

30
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,020
{\an8}I regret not taking

31
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,398
a single photo with Mother.

32
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,113
I should've come to you earlier.

33
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,949
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,914
Do not apologize anymore.

35
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,293
If you continue to do so,

36
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,169
I will feel more guilty.

37
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,010
All right, I won't.

38
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,348
Why don't we
take a picture together sometime?

39
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,643
I'm sure Mom would love to see it.

40
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,147
That sounds good.

41
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,778
<i>Mother,</i>

42
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,033
<i>I shall live by your words from now on.</i>

43
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,452
<i>So please watch over me</i>

44
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,580
<i>from where you are.</i>

45
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,314
<i>He looked so distraught.</i>

46
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,816
<i>I wonder if the funeral went well.</i>

47
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,570
<i>Should I have gone?</i>

48
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,908
<i>No, it's good I didn't.</i>

49
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,451
<i>I need to mind my own business.</i>

50
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,662
<i>But I still should've…</i>

51
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,749
What's wrong with you?
Are you doing squats or something?

52
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,667
Go do it over there.

53
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,212
You're right. I should go over there.

54
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,172
I'll be back.

55
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,103
Yoon-bok!

56
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,110
Master.

57
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,904
Where are you going?

58
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,615
Oh, well…

59
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,119
I was wondering how the funeral went.

60
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,162
So I wanted to pay a visit.

61
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,915
Is that so?

62
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,293
I should have called you first.

63
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,504
I apologize for causing you concern.

64
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,631
Not at all. You had a lot on your mind.

65
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,425
So are you all right?

66
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,764
Yes, I am fine.

67
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,271
To be honest…

68
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,525
it was tough.

69
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,405
However, I am trying to get better.

70
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,325
Oh, I see.

71
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,620
Is there anything I can do for you?

72
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,830
Just tell me.

73
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,500
In that case,

74
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:43,713
please stay by my side
just as you always have.

75
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,964
What?

76
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,970
Of course, I can do that.

77
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,851
<i>Yoon-bok…</i>

78
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,313
<i>has changed.</i>

79
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,986
EPISODE 9
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOON-BOK?

80
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,572
{\an8}It would've been nice
if you stayed until the end.

81
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,866
{\an8}I'm sad to see you go.

82
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,701
{\an8}Thank you for everything.

83
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:17,455
{\an8}You will hear from Seongsan Village
regarding my replacement.

84
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,082
{\an8}Inspector Park, have you…

85
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,294
{\an8}- eaten?
- Yi-bok.

86
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,924
{\an8}PUBLIC OFFICIAL ID
SHIN YI-BOK

87
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:37,099
{\an8}I should've told you sooner,
but I didn't want you to worry.

88
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,895
{\an8}How could you not--

89
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,980
{\an8}I asked him to keep it a secret.

90
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,192
{\an8}I was also the one who volunteered
to go undercover at Seongsangwan.

91
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,572
You should live your life as you wish.

92
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,699
Leave Phony to me.

93
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,409
- However--
- You know,

94
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,912
I'm a pretty good cop.

95
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,916
Yes, she is quite capable.

96
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,507
Very well.

97
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,177
But you must let me know
if you are ever in danger.

98
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,846
I will.

99
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,729
RÉSUMÉ
SHIN YOON-BOK

100
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,732
I know I am starting late,

101
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,527
but I want to give it a try
and pursue my dreams.

102
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,529
Please…

103
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,240
accept me as your pupil.

104
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,077
Everything from your head to your toes,

105
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,954
including your body and mindset,

106
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,373
has to change completely.

107
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,875
Will you be able to walk

108
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,253
such an arduous path?

109
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,803
In that case,

110
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,306
change your clothes first.

111
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,808
First, my clothes.

112
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,898
I don't even want to look.

113
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,569
I'm still traumatized by the time
we went shopping together.

114
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,073
No, I quite like this outfit.

115
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,492
What?

116
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,207
{\an8}FAIR PLAY

117
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,010
{\an8}FIRE NOODLES

118
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,181
You sure you can handle it?

119
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,350
I used to eat this all the time.

120
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,983
It's good.

121
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,032
Look at you!

122
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,325
You can handle your spice.

123
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,509
Was someone here?

124
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,551
Yeah, Yoon-bok.

125
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,387
Yoon-bok?

126
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,517
He asked to be my pupil
so he could pursue his dreams.

127
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,648
<i>Yoon-bok has laid down
the heavy burden on his shoulders</i>

128
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,608
<i>and decided to see
what was out there for him.</i>

129
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,617
The composition is way off!

130
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,496
I tried to portray
the beauty of an empty space.

131
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,373
Just fill up the screen.

132
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,208
What the heck?

133
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,794
Why did you cover his body?

134
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,213
Who showers with their clothes on?

135
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,715
I felt embarrassed.

136
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,468
My apologies.

137
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,097
You don't have to wash your clothes
if you shower in them.

138
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,391
You kill two birds with one stone.
Right, Yoon-bok?

139
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,810
I shower with my clothes on sometimes.

140
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,397
You call yourself a writer
when you can't even think outside the box?

141
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,940
How will you make good stories?

142
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,194
The empty space looks great too.

143
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,364
Don't trample on Yoon-bok's talent, okay?

144
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,701
I'll be back.

145
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,412
Have a great day.

146
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:30,791
Master!

147
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,358
<i>But what has changed
the most about Yoon-bok…</i>

148
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,778
It is chilly today.

149
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,115
Please take care.

150
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,575
<i>…is the way</i>

151
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,453
<i>he looks at me.</i>

152
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,885
Oh my gosh,
he put his scarf around my neck!

153
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,429
It used to be around his neck,

154
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,348
and he put it around mine.

155
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,859
No way.

156
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,903
Does he like me?

157
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,405
Oh gosh!

158
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,160
No, I doubt it.

159
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,916
Maybe he's just being
more affectionate as a pupil.

160
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,466
What's this?

161
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,928
I smell the scent of an unfamiliar man.

162
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,264
What are you talking about?

163
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,683
Are you seeing someone?

164
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,768
Of course not.

165
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,728
Then who put this scarf around you?

166
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,691
I did, of course. Who else?

167
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,901
Hong-do put it around Hong-do's neck.

168
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,408
Well, whoever it was has a sense of style.

169
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,285
I approve.

170
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,099
<i>I will break free!</i>

171
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,685
I will no longer do anything

172
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,313
you have set for me to do,
be it upholding tradition,

173
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,276
leading the village,
or marrying who you want for me.

174
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,030
I shall listen to my mother

175
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,366
and do what I love

176
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,661
and live freely.

177
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,719
<i>It is Yun-a, Lord Shin.</i>

178
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,596
Come in.

179
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,355
How is Yoon-bok?

180
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,316
After the funeral,

181
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,236
he has been living with Lady Yi-bok.

182
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,531
I see.

183
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:54,453
He must need time to heal
after such a loss.

184
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,666
Make sure to assist him

185
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,626
so he may return to his duties swiftly.

186
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,127
Yes, my lord.

187
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,463
And report to me about Yoon-bok regularly.

188
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,298
Understood.

189
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,697
Goodness.

190
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:34,451
He must be in such a bad state
from mourning his mother.

191
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,205
Take good care of him, all right?

192
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,873
I will.

193
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,417
Is he unwell in any way?

194
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,503
No, I don't believe so.

195
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,880
Is he going through a tough time?

196
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,343
It doesn't seem like it.

197
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,762
He's a bit strange though.

198
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,265
Why? Is something wrong?

199
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,100
No, it's nothing serious.

200
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,437
It's just that he has changed a bit.

201
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,438
How?

202
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,023
Well…

203
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:05,733
He just has.

204
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,445
Yes.

205
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,407
He's not the Young Master I used to know.

206
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,575
What?

207
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,839
Yoon-bok!

208
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,343
Master.

209
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,179
What are you doing here?

210
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,183
Writer Kim instructed me to draw that.

211
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,352
I see.

212
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,940
How was your day?

213
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,859
Were you not cold?

214
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,862
No, all thanks to you.

215
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,034
Have you had dinner?

216
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,410
Not yet.

217
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,370
Have you?

218
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,791
No, not yet.

219
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,759
Then do you want to eat together?

220
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:14,843
Yes!

221
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:17,763
Yes.

222
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,777
<i>He shares tables so naturally now.</i>

223
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,577
Master.

224
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,498
Please eat up.

225
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,252
Okay, thank you.

226
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,511
<i>Am I so in love with Yoon-bok</i>

227
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,681
<i>that I'm deluding myself?</i>

228
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,470
<i>No way.</i>

229
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,972
Where are the plates?

230
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,807
Oh, I'll give you one.

231
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,064
I can do it.

232
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,132
<i>No.</i>

233
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,509
<i>This can't just be my delusion.</i>

234
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,096
<i>Yoon-bok is definitely acting strangely.</i>

235
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,731
Master,

236
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,567
please sit here.

237
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,070
- Next to you?
- Yes.

238
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,863
Okay.

239
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,873
<i>No way.</i>

240
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,876
<i>Does he actually like me?</i>

241
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,088
Here, Master.

242
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,049
Thanks.

243
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,053
- Have some too.
- After you, Master.

244
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,810
All right, here you go.

245
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,109
Look how much my pupil cares about me.

246
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,569
He's so well-mannered.

247
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,114
I say, "Well", you say, "Mannered"!

248
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,545
Are you unwell
after what you went through?

249
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,423
You should take it easy.

250
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,144
Did I overdo it today?

251
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,693
Here.

252
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,822
You always had this when you were sick.

253
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,575
My mom

254
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,202
used to make me this.

255
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,788
Don't let it get cold.

256
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:16,877
Thank you.

257
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,010
I can do it.

258
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,012
That was very troublesome to make,

259
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,723
so make sure you finish it.

260
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,488
Sitting here together

261
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,907
reminds me of the past.

262
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,205
We had such a good time,

263
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,290
didn't we?

264
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,808
You fool!

265
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,270
Did you cause that precious child

266
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,980
to become ill?

267
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,573
It's a relief

268
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,993
that it's a fond memory for you.

269
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,748
<i>To me, it's an unforgettable wound.</i>

270
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,752
The villagers are complaining
about your nightly screams.

271
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,463
I asked that you touch their hearts

272
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,298
but you're punching at their eardrums.

273
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:12,219
Try spending a night there.
It's impossible not to scream.

274
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,222
And the cuckoo is nowhere to be seen!

275
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:21,311
I have prepared a place for you
here in Woorim Residence.

276
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,271
You may stay here now.

277
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,066
- Make yourself--
- I'll definitely make myself at home.

278
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,278
This place is so much nicer.

279
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,745
Oh, I just remembered.

280
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,249
I heard about the incident
at the tea house.

281
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,086
You seem to be struggling
to convince the villagers.

282
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,922
If you ever wish to give up,

283
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,340
you may leave freely.

284
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,594
I'm Camille.
Giving up is not in my dictionary.

285
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,805
So don't worry about that.

286
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,267
I'll get all the villagers on board.

287
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,130
Excuse me.

288
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,549
Do not touch them so carelessly.

289
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,259
This is so pretty.

290
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,178
Which are your bestsellers?

291
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,514
The <i>danghye</i>, in the Tang dynasty style.

292
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,475
The <i>unhye</i>, with its cloud pattern,
is also popular.

293
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,107
Oh my.

294
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,110
What's this?

295
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,403
You mean the <i>pichohye</i>?

296
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,904
"<i>Pichohye</i>"?

297
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,035
They are made of leather and straw
and were popular hundreds of years ago.

298
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,079
However, they have long been forgotten
and no one buys them anymore.

299
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,791
How did that happen
to such beautiful shoes?

300
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,964
I'll take this one.

STRONG LADY OH YUN-A EPISODE 1
(WRITER KIM)

307
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,932
This must be a new series.

308
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,191
Okay, let's leave a comment.

309
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:59,195
"Please upload

310
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,990
the next episode soon.

311
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,951
I'm dizzy with excitement."

312
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,871
Oh, I'm finally getting a connection.

313
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,212
My goodness.

314
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,452
It's finally up!

315
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,935
Look how pretty these are.

316
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,813
That's so beautiful.

317
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,815
That woman made these.

318
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,107
- Take a look.
- Oh wow.

319

#PICHOHYE #TRADITIONALSHOES

320
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,404
These are unbelievable.

321
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,156
Amazing.

322
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,574
That woman designed these.

323
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,827
So I heard. They're beautiful.

324
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,787
- Here you go.
- Have a good day.

325
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,665
I'd like a pair of <i>pichohye</i>, please.

326
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,416
- In what size?
- Nine <i>mun</i> and a half.

327
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,334
Just a moment.

328
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,629
Sir, I'd like a pair too.

329
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,631
- What size?
- Nine <i>mun</i>.

330
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,924
All right.

331
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,342
Here you go.

332
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:46,970
Thank you.

333
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,012
Just a moment.

334
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,015
- I want to buy <i>pichohye</i>.
- What?

335
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:52,892
Goodness.

336
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,688
How does a young lady
like you know what <i>pichohye </i>is?

337
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,606
- A pair of <i>pichohye</i>, please.
- Me too.

338
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,899
- Goodness.
- Do you have any more?

339
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,192
These are selling like hotcakes.

340
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,569
Now, please line up!

341
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,531
All right, here you go.

342
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,997
Are you there?

343
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,589
If I have offended you

344
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,426
by modifying your work,

345
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,720
I'd like to apologize.

346
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,015
Not at all.

347
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,979
I am actually here to thank you.

348
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,523
Thanks to you,

349
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,651
these shoes are receiving love again
after so long.

350
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,903
My heart is full.

351
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,283
You saved a tradition
from being completely forgotten.

352
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,287
You're flattering me.

353
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,082
Most importantly,
I have been greatly moved

354
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:02,253
by your skills and creativity.

355
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,802
Then why don't we take this further?

356
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,932
With more ideas like the <i>pichohye</i>,

357
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,184
you and I could collaborate.

358
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,603
"Clap"?

359
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,066
What are we clapping for?

360
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:27,904
Oh my.

361
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,032
She wants to open a pop-up store
for her collaboration

362
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,825
with the shoe craftsman.

363
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,161
#PICHOHYE #TRADITIONALSHOES

364
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:38,206
I guess the villagers are beginning
to warm up to Madam Camille.

365
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:42,460
Seeing that those stubborn people
are changing their minds,

366
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:46,881
they must be falling in love
with our dear Camille.

367
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:05,191
Why are you so far away, Yoon-bok?

368
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,945
I dare not step on your shadow.

369
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,666
Then why are you over there?

370
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,128
As I have said,

371
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,547
a master is like a king and a father.

372
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,592
I could never dream
of sharing a table with my master.

373
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,761
Master.

374
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,724
Please eat up.

375
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,230
<i>I thought Yoon-bok would never change.</i>

376
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,025
<i>But now that he has,</i>

377
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,446
<i>does it mean he's started to like me?</i>

378
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,119
Am I wrong?

379
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:07,211
<i>He likes me, he likes me not.</i>

380
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,130
<i>He likes me, he likes me not.</i>

381
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,214
<i>He likes me…</i>

382
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,133
<i>He likes me not.</i>

383
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,470
<i>Should I just call and ask him?</i>

384
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,348
<i>No, he might push me away again.</i>

385
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,186
I don't know what to think.

386
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,277

391
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,589
So your boyfriend cheated on you?

392
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,219
You better be a tough cookie
and dump that man.

393
00:34:56,302 --> 00:35:00,848
COOKIE POUND CAKE

394
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,562
We're not sure if we should major
in Korean or English literature.

395
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,899
So you're choosing
between Korean or English literature.

396
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:10,817
Yes.

397
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:12,777
Your order is bubble tea.

398
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,320
Bubble tea?

399
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,031
Slowly drink the bubble tea
while counting the pearls.

400
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,367
If they're odd, choose Korean literature.

401
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,327
If they're even, go with English.

402
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,246
Okay.

403
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,750
What's bothering you?

404
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,669
Well…

405
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,589
What?

406
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,008
Hyang-gi!

407
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,219
Hong-do?

408
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,808
My life got ruined
after you left the company.

409
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:48,729
I was blacklisted in the industry
for plagiarism and had a hard time coping.

410
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,524
So I decided not to cope.

411
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,277
Must be nice being rich.

412
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,739
I thought about what I'm good at
aside from designing clothes.

413
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,368
And as you know,
I'm a really good listener.

414
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,496
- You are?
- Yes.

415
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,667
Listening to relationship problems
reminded me of you a lot.

416
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:14,338
And also of that sack of crap
Lee Do-yeong two-timing us.

417
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,009
Wait, you two broke up?

418
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,429
You know what he said
when I told him I was quitting?

419
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,723
He called me a fake!

420
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,225
He said I was the fake
and you were the real one.

421
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,894
That crazy bastard.

422
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,646
That's his classic repertoire.

423
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,691
He told me I was the fake
and you were the real one.

424
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,906
Hong-do.

425
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,700
Hang on for a minute.

426
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:43,826
Okay.

427
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:56,672
It's an apple-berry pie.

428
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,509
I'm "berry" sorry.

429
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,597
I'm sorry for stealing
your design for the lucky pouch

430
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,101
and misunderstanding you
by only believing what Do-yeong said.

431
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,524
Thanks for the pie.

432
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,907
But why are you here?

433
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,118
Is something bothering you?

434
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,041
He helped you separate the perilla leaf?

435
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,753
Then it's obvious he likes you.

436
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,047
But even family members help with that.

437
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,424
Hong-do,

438
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,886
does he smile when he looks at you?

439
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,310
He does.

440
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,563
Then he's absolutely into you!

441
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,899
But smiling doesn't necessarily mean…

442
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,609
Guys only smile when they like you.

443
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,737
Does he smile whenever he sees you?

444
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,323
Does he smile when he rarely used to?

445
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,284
Does he smile only at you?

446
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,411
If the answer is yes to one of them,
it's friendliness.

447
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,621
If it's two, it's flirting.
And if it's all three,

448
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,748
it's true love.

449
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,126
"True love"?

450
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,963
You're a lucky girl, Hong-do!

451
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,717
I don't think it's that serious.

452
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,898
Yoon-bok must be here.

453
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,866
Why do you think it is that you smile
every time you see your master,

454
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:50,870
wonder where they are,
and want to be with them?

455
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,207
That's because you truly love them.

456
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,462
True love…

457
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:01,922
Love?

458
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,050
…is not what it is.

459
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,719
It is simply a pupil's duty
to their master.

460
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,472
That makes no sense.

461
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,390
It's because you love them.

462
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,267
That's right.

463
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,644
- Come on.
- I do not agree.

464
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,689
Those are not signs of love.

465
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,942
Those are actions
that can stem from admiration.

466
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,863
If they misunderstood my actions,

467
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,532
it means they have taken it the wrong way.

468
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,580
Come to think of it,
that's what you do to my sister too.

469
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,003
What did you just say?

470
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,634
I didn't know you could do all that
just out of admiration.

471
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,553
You've helped me understand.

472
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,597
Wait.

473
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,851
I just realized
I have made a grave mistake.

474
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:56,769
What?

475
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,356
I must clear things up
so Master Kim does not misunderstand me.

476
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,441
Our meeting's not over yet.

477
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,406
Where do we even begin with the revision?

478
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,599
<i>Those are not signs of love.</i>

479
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,644
<i>Those are actions
that can stem from admiration.</i>

480
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,605
It wasn't true love.

481
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,984
It was just admiration.

482
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,029
Admiration.

483
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,126
<i>How I feel about Master Kim
may not have been expressed clearly.</i>

484
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:07,339
I must tell her the truth tomorrow.

485
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,097
<i>Is Master Kim home?</i>

486
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:16,682
She's at work.

487
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,309
Already?

488
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,269
She left earlier than usual.

489
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,065
- What's that?
- Well, it's…

490
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,194
<i>Ssanghwa</i> tea?

491
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,405
- This smells amazing.
- Just a moment.

492
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,282
This is not for you.

493
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,660
- I just want a sip.
- No, this is for me.

494
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,579
It is mine.

495
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,338
I'm not ready yet.

496
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:50,132
I'm not ready to get my heart broken!

497
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,065
Seongsangwan?

498
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,278
<i>We checked the areas with no CCTV coverage
and noticed Seongsangwan.</i>

499
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,947
We checked just in case

500
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,492
and found that the products delivered
before stopping by Seongsangwan were fine.

501
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:21,497
So you're saying Seongsangwan
is connected to this case?

502
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,918
Even the thug we caught last time

503
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,295
said Seongsangwan
is where Phony conducts business.

504
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:32,675
This could mean that Phony
was responsible for what happened.

505
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,637
I'll see if anything suspicious
is going on at Seongsangwan.

506
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,022
All profits will be donated
to support the efforts

507
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,774
to bring our cultural assets home.

508
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:53,612
This will promote the fashion show,
raise the image of the brand,

509
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,156
and help the Administration.

510
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:00,411
Now, what can we do to help?

511
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:06,917
We were hoping you could recommend
a location for the pop-up store.

512
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:12,840
It should be befitting of both Camille
and Seongsan Village.

513
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,469
Oh, I know just the location.

514
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:24,893
SEONGSANGWAN

515
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:28,897
I'm sure it wasn't
an easy decision to make.

516
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,609
Thank you very much
for agreeing to our proposal.

517
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,278
I'm glad to help Administrator Lee.

518
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,156
Have a look around
and let me know your thoughts.

519
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,866
I'll take them into consideration.

520
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:39,783
Thank you.

521
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,243
If you will excuse me.

522
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:46,832
How nice.

523
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,210
This place is perfect.

524
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,938
We can set it up right here.

525
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,690
Say cheese.

526
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,236
I'll take a look at the backyard.

527
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,696
Okay.

528
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:25,162
I can't believe
how pretty those flowers are.

529
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,475
A face that's both classic and modern.

530
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,437
Flawless proportions.

531
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,900
Are you interested in modeling?

532
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,612
I am sorry, but…

533
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:48,954
Do you work for Camille?

534
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,791
Yes, I work for <i>the</i> Camille.

535
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,418
Is that so?

536
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,254
I know someone who works for Camille.

537
00:45:57,796 --> 00:46:00,299
Do you know someone who goes by
the first name Hong-do and last name Kim?

538
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,134
Kim Hong-do?

539
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,552
Do you know Hong-do Kim?

540
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,681
She's here with me.

541
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,391
Master Kim is here?

542
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,018
Where?

543
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,316
Hong-do!

544
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,779
What are you doing?

545
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:25,866
Master!

546
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,081
Hey, Yoon-bok.

547
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,543
You're here too.

548
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,420
What's the occasion?

549
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,465
This is good timing.

550
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,260
I need to talk to you and Master.

551
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,095
Master,

552
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,182
do you have time to--

553
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:53,519
Oh gosh, look at the time.

554
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,563
I'm sorry, but I need to
get back to the office.

555
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,650
We're quite busy, aren't we?

556
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,027
We are?

557
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,737
Oh dear!

558
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,949
It will be very brief.

559
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,617
I must speak with you.

560
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,994
I'm sorry,
but Madam Camille's waiting for us.

561
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,454
We should go.

562
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,872
I'm really sorry.

563
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:14,957
Master…

564
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,135
SEONGSANGWAN

565
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,387
This is strange.

566
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,100
Why do I smell your scent

567
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:36,061
from an unfamiliar man?

568
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:37,729
What?

569
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,815
Is he the owner of the scarf?

570
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,234
No.

571
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,279
No, he's not.

572
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,030
We should hurry.

573
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,116
Come on.

574
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,119
I know I'm right, girl.

575
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,037
Wait for me.

576
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,128
Wait for me, Hong-do Kim!

577
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,840
So you need to talk to me?

578
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,800
I wonder what it's about.

579
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:07,801
Relationship advice?

580
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,013
To be honest…

581
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,227
I overheard your phone call
with Inspector Park.

582
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:21,189
Again, with the case.

583
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,483
I told you I'd handle it.

584
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:30,282
All signs point to Phony being involved
with the fire from 17 years ago.

585
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,369
What?

586
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,954
Since Phony has a burn on his arm,

587
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:41,001
you should observe the arms
of the people who come and go here.

588
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,662
Let's speed things up!

589
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,581
How's the VIP's main course going?

590
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,041
It's almost done, sir!

591
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,669
Let's hurry up a bit.

592
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,680
So?

593
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,306
Are they saying it's a flop?

594
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,767
Do they want me to quit?

595
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,019
It is nothing like that.

596
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,480
Are there no comments at all?

597
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,484
Take a look for yourself.

598
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,078
<i>I love your sense of justice, Writer Kim!</i>

599
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,498
<i>I smell a big hit.</i>

600
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,624
<i>It's so fun.</i>

601
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,168
<i>The female protagonist is badass.</i>

602
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,295
<i>The writer must've made a deal
with the devil. Amazing story.</i>

603
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,132
<i>Please upload the next episode soon.
I'm dizzy with excitement.</i>

604
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:15,053
Are these really the comments on my work?

605
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,180
Am I dreaming right now?

606
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,769
Well, I do not know.

607
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,855
I think these comments

608
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,899
are praising the protagonist.

609
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,778
Good job, Writer Kim.

610
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:36,700
You gave me material, inspiration,
and now even bread.

611
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,995
How are you so generous to me?

612
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,247
Yun-a!

613
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,254
I need to go to the bathroom.
Stay here and eat that.

614
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,177
You're seeing someone else,

615
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:56,803
aren't you?

616
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,222
Is that why you want to break up?

617
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,807
That's not it!

618
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,350
I just…

619
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,020
don't love you anymore.

620
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,150
Hey.

621
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,778
Hey, you.

622
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:16,114
<i>The writer must be a strong man
who fights against injustice.</i>

623
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:22,037
You little…

624
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,464
Who the hell are you?

625
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,548
Me?

626
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,802
Let me introduce myself.

627
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:40,388
I'm Kim Hong-hak,
a strong man who fights against…

628
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,103
That bastard.

629
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,069
I'm bleeding.

630
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,071
Damn it.

631
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:00,534
Were you with her last night?

632
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,520
You need to pick your fights.

633
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,397
What if I was not here to save you?

634
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:42,367
Still, you were quite cool.

635
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,162
Really?

636
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:51,710
Strength is worthless without courage.

637
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:55,589
You may be weak
but you have a lot of courage,

638
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,132
so you have the potential…

639
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,552
to become a strong man in the future.

640
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,890
Then I'll muster up
the courage and go back…

641
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,808
Just sit down.

642
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,860
Jeez.

643
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,445
It's not stuck on properly.

644
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,449
What are you laughing about?

645
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,783
Jeez.

646
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,786
- The wound of a strong man.
- Goodness.

647
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,335
All done.

648
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,389
<i>When are you done, Master?</i>

649
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,974
<i>May I walk you home?</i>

650
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,396
<i>No, I'm working late tonight.</i>

651
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,481
<i>See you some other time.</i>

652
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,115
CAMILLE IN SEONGSAN

653
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,951
BRINGING SEONGSAN TO THE CITY

654
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,620
EXPECTED EFFECTS OF THE POP-UP STORE

655
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,956
Should I make the font bigger?

656
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,084
Yeah, that would be better.

657
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,543
And I should change the color.

658
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,239
Is anyone in there?

659
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:50,745
Master…

660
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,549
Yoon-bok!

661
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,981
<i>Master Kim may feel uncomfortable,</i>

662
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,775
<i>so I must pretend to be busy.</i>

663
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,209
Yoon-bok!

664
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,546
Master.

665
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,548
What are you doing here?

666
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:30,136
Writer Kim instructed me to draw that.

667
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,431
I see.

668
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,778
<i>She will need a plate for the fruit.</i>

669
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,657
Where are the plates?

670
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,826
Oh, I'll give you one.

671
00:56:58,331 --> 00:56:59,541
I can do it.

672
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,814
<i>We might need another plate.</i>

673
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:31,072
It seems we need another plate.

674
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,366
Oh, okay.

675
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,093
Do not go.

676
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,484
Yoon-bok.

677
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:36,614
I like you.

678
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,078
I…

679
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,040
I like you, Master.

680
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,257
{\an8}EPILOGUE

681
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,759
{\an8}THAT IS ENOUGH.
IT IS TIME TO PART WAYS.

682
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:40,762
{\an8}This character is dripping with swagger.

683
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,264
{\an8}I know I'm tooting my own horn, but--

684
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,182
{\an8}This is absurd!

685
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:48,853
{\an8}- What is?
- To share a kiss is to share your hearts.

686
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:51,230
{\an8}It is absurd that they would part ways!

687
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,107
{\an8}So what do you want me to do?

688
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,236
{\an8}Since they shared a kiss,
they must consider marriage.

689
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,491
{\an8}How could you take
such an encounter so lightly?

690
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,912
{\an8}I will go cool down with some cold water.

691
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:07,872
{\an8}Unbelievable!

692
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:10,958
{\an8}Completely absurd!

693
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:14,629
{\an8}We really don't click.

694
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,215
{\an8}I'll have to cut him soon.

695
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,352
{\an8}<i>Master, would you like
to spend time with me tomorrow?</i>

696
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,646
{\an8}It's so nice here.

697
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,356
{\an8}<i>It is heaven on earth.</i>

698
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,149
{\an8}<i>It means you're that cute!</i>

699
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,943
{\an8}It means you're cute enough
to shake the world.

700
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,736
{\an8}Hong-do's such an easy girl!

701
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,489
{\an8}She holds hands
with any guy who feels her out.

702
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:44,117
{\an8}Master, do not look back.

703
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,746
{\an8}- Master?
- <i>Just a minute, Yoon-bok.</i>

704
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:51,207
{\an8}Master!

705
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:56,295

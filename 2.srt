1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,000
Wake up!

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,680
Do you want to be late on your first day of school?

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,800
Hey, Chad! Wait for me!

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,360
The girl who’s hiding behind her bag.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,160
My nickname is Som-O.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,000
I’m Chadjen.

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,359
But that isn’t Khao.

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,240
That’s Chadjen.

9
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,999
Someone ran me over and I dropped my glasses.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,440
Someone picked them up for me.

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,440
When I put my glasses back on, she was already gone.

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,200
You.

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,520
The school forbids students to write letters of this nature

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,840
That letter was supposed to go to Chadjen, wasn’t it?

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,800
I said I’d visit after a year, right?

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,400
Did you forget that?

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,720
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

18
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,200
Faster.

19
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,640
Okay.

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,000
Faster, faster.

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,880
If your record is not good, you won’t get to have lunch.

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,560
Hurry up. We are late.

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,280
Why did Coach tell us to come here today?

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,840
I don’t know but the pool is big.

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,040
You are late.

26
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,920
Line up.

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,920
You are late.

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,280
The three of you do ten push-ups.

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,600
- Do it. - Coach…

30
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,680
Now!

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,959
I’ll make you do another ten push-ups if you’re slow.

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,160
See? I told you to hurry.

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,440
Six.

34
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,440
Seven.

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,759
- Eight. - Go lower.

36
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,400
Nine.

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,160
Ten.

38
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,880
I’m done.

39
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
Don’t be late next time.

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,440
A new member will join our team today.

41
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,120
I heard that he won the student championship last year.

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,000
He just moved to our school.

43
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,000
He’s late on his first day.

44
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,640
I planned to have you guys compete with him.

45
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
I guess he’s too scared.

46
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,400
I’m sorry.

47
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,880
You are late on your first day.

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,480
I’m sorry.

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,240
I was assigned to raise the national flag.

50
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,000
Next time, don’t join the flag-raising ceremony.

51
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,600
Athletes only focus on practices. Do you hear me?

52
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,920
Yes.

53
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,480
Go practice.

54
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,280
Go.

55
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,400
Run around the pool. The clock is ticking.

56
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,400
You have 20 minutes.

57
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,080
Go.

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,440
Come on. Let’s go.

59
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,040
Why are you here?

60
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,160
I was at the flag-raising ceremony. What do you want me to do?

61
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,680
If you don’t finish it in 20 minutes, you’ll need to do it again.

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,120
Go. Ten laps.

63
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,480
The slow ones try to catch up.

64
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,800
20 seconds has passed.

65
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,680
So you won the student championship last year?

66
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,120
Yes.

67
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,240
Coach Yut is tough and has no mercy.

68
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,080
You made a mistake joining this team, Chad.

69
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,640
Let’s have a competition.

70
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,480
100-metre freestyle.

71
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
The loser will clean the locker room for one day.

72
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,960
Go.

73
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,760
Stay focus. Don’t get distracted.

74
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,840
Wait for my signal.

75
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,760
Ready?

76
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,280
You two are tied.

77
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,720
You are pretty good.

78
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,680
Next time, I won’t let it end in a tie.

79
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,840
Tao.

80
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Even though it’s a tie, you need to clean the locker room.

81
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,760
Why, Coach?

82
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,400
You don’t know why?

83
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,440
You have no other choice but to win.

84
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,640
A tie is a loss.

85
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,560
Remember that.

86
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,880
Go.

87
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,200
Take your seat.

88
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,080
Hello, everyone.

89
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,120
I have an announcement to make about our school’s annual event.

90
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,040
Excuse me.

91
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,640
Chadjen, I heard that you joined the swimming team.

92
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,640
Does it mean I will have two students be late regularly?

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,680
Teacher, we are practicing hard.

94
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,720
We’re late for only a few minutes.

95
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,080
This is the second period.

96
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,200
Go take your seat.

97
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,400
Hurry up.

98
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,040
What’s up, geek?

99
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,200
I feel so sleepy.

100
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,400
What?

101
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,280
Are you really joining the swimming team?

102
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,520
Do you miss the pool?

103
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,720
Back to the announcement.

104
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,600
This Friday, our school will hold the Father’s Day event like the previous years.

105
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,520
I want you to invite your father to join the event.

106
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,760
I’m off the hook. My dad is living overseas.

107
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,000
I want to cry.

108
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,200
I moved to a new school but I couldn’t run away from the event.

109
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,600
My dad often boasts about how talented I am to other people.

110
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,640
New, he does that because he loves you.

111
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,280
He also likes to flaunt his wealth.

112
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
I don’t like it.

113
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,440
It’s because your family is wealthy.

114
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,600
I’m worse than you.

115
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,600
I see my dad at home and the pool.

116
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,200
Now, I have to see him at this event.

117
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,760
Som-O, are you going to invite your dad to the event?

118
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,800
I have to even if I don’t want to.

119
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,640
He loves the Father’s Day event.

120
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,960
He asks to attend it every year.

121
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,520
Chad, what about you?

122
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,240
Remember this.

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,080
If you want or don’t want to do something,

124
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,360
you need to be honest with them, regardless of who they are.

125
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,800
Do you get it?

126
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,640
Yes.

127
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,640
Chad.

128
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,000
You spaced out?

129
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,280
Are you going to invite your dad?

130
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,880
No.

131
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,440
Stop chatting.

132
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,360
Kulasatri, please hand the assignment back to your classmates.

133
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,120
Sure.

134
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,000
Please check your score.

135
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,000
Gewalin.

136
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,880
You got one point.

137
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,280
Please come to see me during the lunch break to redo the assignment

138
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,320
Chadjen.

139
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,360
You got the highest score.

140
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Please come to help Gewalin with the assignment.

141
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,880
- Chadjen not only gets good grades but also participates in school activities.
- Oh, Aunt Aun.

142
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,600
Hello, Aunt Aun.

143
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,440
Didn’t you say you would see me at home?

144
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,840
Surprise!

145
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,480
I came to talk to your teacher.

146
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,480
I also want to see how you are doing at school.

147
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,880
Chadjen, are you taller than the last time we met?

148
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,040
Som.

149
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,960
We didn’t see each other for only a short while. Now, you are all grown up.

150
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,480
Not really.

151
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,760
You become much prettier.

152
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,400
I left the souvenir for you with your parents.

153
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,720
I hope you like it.

154
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,240
Thank you, Aunt Aun.

155
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,400
Chad, Som-O, can you go wait outside?

156
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,600
Let’s go home together.

157
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,760
I need to talk to your teacher.

158
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,880
Sure.

159
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,040
Excuse me, Teacher.

160
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,760
I have to ask you to take care of Chad for 1-2 years.

161
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,000
He can take care of himself.

162
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,000
He asked me to let him stay though I want to take him with me.

163
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,360
Don’t worry. My home is always open for him.

164
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,400
We’ve known each other for years since he was born.

165
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,920
I can raise him like he’s my second child.

166
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,800
If he misbehaves, you can lecture. Don’t worry about how I would feel.

167
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,240
Misbehave? He’s such a good boy.

168
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,080
Chadjen, if you need help, you can always come to me.

169
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,200
Don’t be shy.

170
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,600
If you need help, you can always run to my home.

171
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,240
I’ll help take care of your house.

172
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,480
Thank you so much.

173
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,600
I got to go.

174
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,640
I have to go now, Som.

175
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,080
Goodbye, Aunt Aun.

176
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,880
I’ll call you when I arrive in Paris.

177
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:50,840
Yes.

178
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,280
Be a good boy.

179
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,160
Take care of Mom.

180
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,000
Take care.

181
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,280
Chadjen.

182
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,840
Chad.

183
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,000
Chadjen.

184
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,680
Chad.

185
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,000
Are you okay?

186
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,960
Is your mom back for good?

187
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,880
I don’t think so.

188
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,880
What is she doing at school?

189
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
Sorry, Som-O.

190
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,320
I heard Chadjen’s mom came to school.

191
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,480
Yes.

192
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,680
She was living in France for a year.

193
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,640
She just came back and wanted to meet his teacher.

194
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,760
She will go back soon.

195
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,200
Paris?

196
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,200
Isn’t it awkward between them? They hadn’t seen each other for a long time.

197
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,000
My dad is also working overseas.

198
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,240
I only get to see him every 4-5 years.

199
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,760
When he came back, I felt that we grew distant.

200
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,720
Will she move back to Thailand permanently?

201
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,080
Is he living with his dad?

202
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,200
The thing is Chad’s mom…

203
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,400
Do you see Chadjen?

204
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,160
I think he went home with his mom.

205
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,160
His mom came to meet our teacher.

206
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,320
Why?

207
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,000
I don’t know.

208
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Coach just told me that he and I are going to join a competition this Saturday.

209
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,400
Why don’t you come to cheer us?

210
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,160
Can I go?

211
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,640
Of course. Why not?

212
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
You all can come.

213
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,400
I’ve known Chad since we were born.

214
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,200
I’ve never gone to watch his game.

215
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,480
He said that no visitors were allowed.

216
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,120
He lied to you.

217
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,880
Of course, you can come.

218
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,560
Come to cheer both Chad and me.

219
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,840
Yes, I’ll go.

220
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,840
Can Khao and I go too?

221
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,760
Sure, but you need to cheer for only me, not Chad.

222
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,160
I will definitely go.

223
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,120
I want to see how good this braggart is at swimming.

224
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,120
Sure.

225
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,000
If you see how fast I can pull my strokes…

226
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,680
and reach the wall,

227
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,440
You will be surprised.

228
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,920
Is that so?

229
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,680
Yes.

230
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,120
I got to go.

231
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,000
I have to clean the locker room.

232
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,360
My coach punished me for losing to Chad.

233
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,840
Bye.

234
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,520
See? I told you.

235
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,080
Did you hear it? He said he lost to Chad.

236
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,920
Yes, I heard it.

237
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,600
Som, who do you think will win?

238
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,360
I think Chadjen will win.

239
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,120
Right?

240
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,240
I won’t be home much while I’m staying here.

241
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,240
I’ll have business meetings.

242
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,600
I’m looking for an opportunity to start a business importing and exporting goods from Paris.

243
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,720
Yes.

244
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,400
Why did you go see my teacher today?

245
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,960
I just had a general talk with her.

246
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,560
I asked her how you are doing at school and if you made any new friends.

247
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,120
From the look on your face, you don’t believe me, do you?

248
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,480
Any moms want to know how their kids are doing.

249
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,840
Yes.

250
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,760
Today is the Father’s Day.

251
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,999
Thank you to all the parents who attended our school’s event.

252
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,560
Students, please place the garland on your parents’ hands.

253
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,080
Then pay respect to your parent.

254
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,640
This is a memorable moment.

255
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,000
The first batch of students, please return to your seat.

256
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,720
What a beautiful picture.

257
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,400
Fathers, please sit down.

258
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,440
Students, please give the garland to your father.

259
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,880
Here is the garland, Dad.

260
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,480
Thank you.

261
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,520
I wish you happiness.

262
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,520
Good.

263
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,080
This is my son, New.

264
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,880
He’s very talented.

265
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,800
The other day, he wrote a 10-page short story.

266
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,200
He got the talent from me. I’m a writer.

267
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,000
If I support him, he can win the S.E.A. Write Award.

268
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,920
But I think he should pursue another career that can make more money.

269
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,640
So he will be rich.

270
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,800
That’s great.

271
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,999
My daughter, Som, can be hit-or-miss.

272
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,760
Really?

273
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,680
New is not much different from me, Dad.

274
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,720
Now, I’m going to tell you my story.

275
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,960
I wrote ‘Bamboo Forest.’

276
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,800
It’s published 29 times.

277
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,880
More than 1 million copies are sold, excluding the e-book version.

278
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,560
It’s very popular.

279
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,640
It’s a best-selling book.

280
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,680
That’s his only best-selling book.

281
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,640
Som.

282
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,400
Look there.

283
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,440
That’s Tao.

284
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,960
He looks dejected.

285
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
He only lost one match but he’s treated like he’s never done anything right.

286
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,160
Actually, it was a tie.

287
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,560
For a home team, a tie means a loss.

288
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,440
That’s so cool. Her mom came instead of her dad.

289
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,080
That’s right.

290
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,880
Let’s help out.

291
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,640
They are working well together.

292
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,120
They are young and strong.

293
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,240
Som.

294
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,960
Give it to me.

295
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,720
Are you sure you can carry it?

296
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,400
Sure.

297
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Excuse me. I have something to ask.

298
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,240
Does your kid have any distractions?

299
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,480
Are you talking about dating?

300
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,520
Yes.

301
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,680
I don’t think New has a girlfriend.

302
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,880
We are close.

303
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,280
If he has a girlfriend, he will tell me.

304
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,000
Khao doesn’t say anything about it.

305
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,400
I think they may not be interested in dating yet.

306
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,800
Tao wouldn’t dare to date anyone.

307
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,360
I warned him.

308
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,960
If he has a girlfriend, he will be kicked out of the team.

309
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,440
He’s very firm on that.

310
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,840
Preecha, no offense.

311
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,640
You have a daughter. You need to be watchful.

312
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,880
Especially when she is in this age, you need to keep a close eye on her.

313
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,680
Don't close the barn door after the horse runs away.

314
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,640
Right.

315
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,400
There’s nothing to worry about Som-O.

316
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,760
Chadjen helps me take care of her.

317
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,320
I don’t think there will be any problems.

318
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,000
Why do you trust Chadjen?

319
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,400
Chad is like my son.

320
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,320
They grew up together.

321
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,600
I practically raised them together.

322
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,680
They are closer than siblings.

323
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,000
There’s nothing to worry about.

324
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,840
Look at them.

325
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,280
The Father’s Day event was good.

326
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,440
I got to meet other parents.

327
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,000
Som-O, why do you always give me such short notice about it?

328
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,200
You don’t want me to know about the event, do you?

329
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,080
Dad.

330
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,760
You always embarrass me.

331
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,760
You often say weird stuff to my teacher.

332
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,800
Ms. Oh.

333
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,800
Can I talk to you?

334
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,840
Yes.

335
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,240
Now, Som-O is in high school.

336
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,400
I want you to keep a close eye on her.

337
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,360
If she lays eyes on any boy, please inform me immediately.

338
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,240
I want to nid it in the bud.

339
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,800
Sure.

340
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,400
Teach 		I agree with you.

341
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,920
I’ll inform you immediately.

342
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,120
We need to keep a close eye on kids these days.

343
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:55,080
I guarantee that our school neither has a policy nor encourages dating among our students.

344
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,240
Am I right, Ms. Oh?

345
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,960
Yes.

346
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,640
I’m glad to hear that.

347
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,960
Teach		Alright.

348
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,600
I’ll keep a close eye on every student.

349
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,640
If they break the rules, I’ll take action.

350
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,400
I’ll take action immediately.

351
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,000
Good.

352
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,120
Dad, did you say anything strange to my teacher?

353
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,240
No, why would I talk to her?

354
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,440
Chadjen.

355
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,680
Where are you holding your father’s memorial service?

356
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,680
I’ll attend it.

357
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,720
It takes place at See Suk Temple this Saturday.

358
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,720
This Saturday?

359
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,320
Don’t you have a swimming competition?

360
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,920
Everyone is going to watch you and Tao this Saturday.

361
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,840
I have to attend my dad’s memorial service.

362
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,080
Wait.

363
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,520
Who is Tao?

364
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,280
Stop being dramatic. He’s my friend.

365
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,400
Chad can confirm it.

366
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,800
He’s just a friend.

367
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,880
That’s alright.

368
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,160
See Suk Temple?

369
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,080
It’s not far. It’s not hard to go there.

370
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,800
This Saturday? Don’t you have a doctor's appointment?

371
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,280
A doctor’s appointment?

372
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,280
Can you check the schedule on your phone?

373
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,240
There’s no schedule here.

374
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,000
Did you take a photo of the appointment form?

375
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,120
It’s okay. We can check it later.

376
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,080
She and I will attend the service.

377
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,440
We may be a bit late.

378
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,720
If you have an appointment, it’s okay.

379
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I don’t want to bother you.

380
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,600
It’s okay.

381
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,400
Can you check it?

382
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,999
You don’t even know your own schedule.

383
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,320
Why do you ask her about it?

384
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,120
What about you?

385
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,760
Of course, I’ll go.

386
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,240
I’ll look for the appointment form.

387
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,000
(Homemade steamed eggs recipe)

388
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,840
Here is your milk.

389
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,800
Can I go to your dad’s memorial service this Saturday?

390
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,720
When will it start?

391
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,840
At 1 pm.

392
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,680
Okay.

393
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,040
Mom.

394
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,000
Are you really going?

395
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,480
Yes.

396
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,400
Don’t go to bed late.

397
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,640
Hello, everyone.

398
00:24:53,240 --> 00:25:00,320
Welcome to Thailand Swimming Championship 2011.

399
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,680
Before the race begins, I would like to introduce all six swimmers.

400
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,040
In lane number 2, Nakrob Sudpreecha.

401
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,360
His nickname is Shark Tao.

402
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,160
He’s a rising star that anyone feels intimidated by.

403
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,000
I wonder if he eats salmon for every meal.

404
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,280
Tao, you can do it!

405
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,920
Tao, you can do it.

406
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,680
Why don’t you put your effort into school as much as when you made this?

407
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,639
I made it to cheer on our friend.

408
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,520
In lane number 3, Panupong Nitikulchai.

409
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,760
In lane number 4, Pichit Mormuang.

410
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,000
In lane number 5, Metawin Tongsamrit.

411
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,800
In lane number 6, Kemmawat Ramsiri.

412
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,320
In lane number 7, Paphankorn Kamon-anekkul.

413
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,640
These are the six swimmers.

414
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:09,160
Please give them a round of applause.

415
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,000
Where are Chadjen? Doesn’t he join the competition?

416
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,560
He has an errand to do this afternoon.

417
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,800
What errand is more important than this?

418
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,360
Let’s cheer on Tao.

419
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,680
The race is about to start.

420
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,400
Take your mark.

421
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,320
You can do it.

422
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,880
Tao.

423
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,520
Faster.

424
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,320
- I can’t watch it anymore. - Tao!

425
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,040
You can do it.

426
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,080
Shark Tao is taking the lead.

427
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,880
He almost reaches the wall.

428
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,199
Please cheer on him.

429
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,920
He’s getting close.

430
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:30,960
Almost there.

431
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,520
He touches the wall.

432
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,400
It’s a dominant win.

433
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,600
It’s too bad that he didn’t break his record.

434
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,520
But it’s okay. He’s still young.

435
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,160
The goal of joining the national team is within his reach.

436
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,720
Please make some noise for Shark Tao and his victory.

437
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,800
Tao.

438
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,200
You were amazing.

439
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,720
How are you feeling, the national athlete?

440
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,760
Khao, I haven’t gotten on the team yet.

441
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,800
I’d better ask for your autograph. When you become famous, I’ll sell it.

442
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,600
Me, too.

443
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,120
But I’m not satisfied with the result.

444
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,920
Hello.

445
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,600
If you can’t break the record, don’t dream of joining the national team this year.

446
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,680
One more thing, Chad didn’t join the competition.

447
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,080
The result means nothing.

448
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,280
It’s okay, Tao.

449
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,680
I’m not that serious about getting on the national team.

450
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,400
It’s boring.

451
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,120
Som.

452
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,400
I saw your banner.

453
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,640
This?

454
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,800
Let’s exchange them.

455
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,480
Are you sure?

456
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,680
Yes.

457
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,600
Every time you come to cheer me, let’s exchange my medal for your banner.

458
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,200
Here.

459
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,720
Everyone.

460
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,480
I have a favor to ask you guys.

461
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,400
She gave up her sleep for this?

462
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,000
I’m out of breath.

463
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,600
I thought you wouldn’t come.

464
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,360
Of course, I will come.

465
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,880
I told you I would come.

466
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,840
Where is your mom?

467
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,080
Let’s go inside.

468
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,200
Hey, wait for us. Why are you so hurry?

469
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,440
If you two go in alone, don’t you feel lonely?

470
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,200
Why didn’t you tell us?

471
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,800
I’m sorry, Chad. I didn’t know about your dad.

472
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,200
So I kept asking you about him.

473
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,120
It’s okay, Khao.

474
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,560
I told them about the service. But they said they want to come.

475
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,840
Of course, I have to come. You are my friend.

476
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,400
You are our friend.

477
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,080
Of course, we will come.

478
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,040
You are not alone anymore, Chad.

479
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,840
That’s right.

480
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,240
Let’s go inside.

481
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,280
Yes.

482
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,080
Let’s go.

483
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,600
Yes.

484
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,600
Let’s go, Geek.

485
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,080
Let’s go.

486
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,680
It’s hot.

487
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,760
My goodness.

488
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Is this a kitchen or a battlefield?

489
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,520
Mom.

490
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,120
Do you need my help?

491
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,800
It seems like you can’t do it by yourself.

492
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,120
I want to make steamed eggs.

493
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,839
You are cooking the favorite dish for…

494
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,400
For who?

495
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Whose favorite dish is it?

496
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,280
It’s everyone’s favorite dish.

497
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,800
You also like it.

498
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,160
But if it’s such a trouble to make it, you should buy it instead.

499
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,600
I’ll make it as delicious as the one served in a Michelin restaurant.

500
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,720
Michelin restaurant?

501
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,840
I think this is a good idea to make Chad’s favorite food for him.

502
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,360
Since his mom is back, he is a bit out of sorts.

503
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,600
Mom, do you think I can do it?

504
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,639
Dad always suspects every move of mine to be an act of love.

505
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,080
I’m stressed out because of it.

506
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,320
Your dad may see it that way but it doesn’t mean he’s right.

507
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,400
No one can control your feelings.

508
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,120
Don’t pay attention to him.

509
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,280
Use low heat.

510
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,320
Let it cook slowly.

511
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,600
So the surface will look smooth.

512
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,800
You need to take it slow. It will come out well.

513
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,719
Is it ready, your Michelin dish?

514
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,080
I’m making it. You keep bugging me.

515
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,000
Honey, add this a bit more.

516
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,840
But I added quite a lot of it already.

517
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,040
What do I need to do next?

518
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,560
Chad, I’m sorry.

519
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,880
I have a meeting with my friends today.

520
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,960
I haven’t seen them for a long time.

521
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,840
I couldn’t attend your dad’s memorial service.

522
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,240
It’s okay.

523
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,560
That’s great.

524
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,320
You’re not mad at me, are you?

525
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,320
Why are you packing my bag?

526
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,000
I’m helping you pack your bag.

527
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,840
So you don’t have to waste your time doing it.

528
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,000
I won’t go back for another week.

529
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,600
You don’t have to hurry.

530
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,280
You know why I came back.

531
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,880
Are you ready?

532
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,280
Chad, you forgot to lock the door again.

533
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,160
I’m pretty good at cooking.

534
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,600
I don’t want to go.

535
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,120
You are giving up on a good future.

536
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,880
What’s good about this place? You are holding on to the past.

537
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,160
You don’t want to go.

538
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,840
I get it.

539
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,880
Aren’t you worried about me?

540
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,200
I’m living there alone.

541
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,280
I want to see you have a bright future.

542
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,760
A better future than staying here.

543
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,640
Chad.

544
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,120
I’ll pick you up in the evening.

545
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,000
Yes.

546
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,120
Have fun with your swimming class.

547
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,440
Be careful.

548
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,600
Dad.

549
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,320
Chadjen, you did great.

550
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,600
You stay here alone for this long.

551
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,800
Mom doesn’t come to pick me up yet.

552
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,680
Can I go home with you?

553
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,600
We talked about it. Your mom and I are separated.

554
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,680
I can’t take you with me.

555
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,680
How about this?

556
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,280
I’ll come to meet you at the pool.

557
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,400
When you come here, I’ll come to wait for you.

558
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,800
Do you mean it?

559
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,280
Dad kept his promise.

560
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
He came to meet me every time I went to the pool.

561
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,800
One day, he didn’t come.

562
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,840
I found out later that he left me forever.

563
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,440
Alright.

564
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,400
You may not understand how much debt your father left behind.

565
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,080
I have to work so hard to support you and your brother

566
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,400
that I don’t have much time for you.

567
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,120
I don’t know what else I can say.

568
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,400
I get it.

569
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,280
You need to make a decision.

570
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,200
If you don’t do it, I’ll force you.

571
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,480
I already prepared the document for you to go to France.

572
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,280
All you need to do is sign it.

573
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,200
You should have asked me first.

574
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I don’t need to ask you.

575
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,400
This is the right decision.

576
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,120
I don’t see anything bad about it.

577
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,080
One more thing, you should have come with me in the first place.

578
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,680
But I have my goal.

579
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,800
I’m going to a med school here.

580
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,080
If I want to go there, I will find a way.

581
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,400
Chadjen, you can go to a med school anywhere.

582
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,080
You can go to a med school there.

583
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,040
What is so special about this place?

584
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,000
(Mom is exactly the same.)

585
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,840
(She has never changed.)

586
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,240
(She will never change.)

587
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,880
(I was looking for the recipe all night.)

588
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,040
(Your favorite dish is hard to make.)

589
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,200
Here is your favorite steamed egg.

590
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,080
It’s also my favorite.

591
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,800
Steamed egg is a simple dish suitable for everyone.

592
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,120
It’s easy to cook it. But it’s not easy to make it delicious.

593
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,680
Chad, from now on, I will no longer live with your mom.

594
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,080
You need to be strong.

595
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,880
Men don’t cry.

596
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,800
Don’t show your feelings to anyone.

597
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:18,000
Now it’s time for you to choose who you want to live with.

598
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,440
I think I want to live with Mom.

599
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,000
Because I don’t want to eat steamed eggs every day.

600
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,040
Remember this.

601
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,920
If you want or don’t want to do something,

602
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,600
you need to be honest with them, regardless of who they are.

603
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,920
Do you get it?

604
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,800
Yes.

605
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,680
From now on, you need to choose for yourself.

606
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,200
You don’t need to worry how your mom or I would feel.

607
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,720
Promise me.

608
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,640
Good boy. Don’t cry.

609
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,240
Let’s eat the steamed eggs.

610
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,120
I’ll spoon you a big bite.

611
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,600
Here, Chad

612
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,600
Eat it.

613
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,440
Does it taste good?

614
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,680
Yes.

615
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,600
It’s delicious.

616
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,880
Thank you, Som.

617
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,040
Are you really going to live in France, Chad?

618
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,760
Let me introduce the new school’s mascot for this year.

619
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,760
Is anyone interested in joining the race?

620
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,320
Ms. Oh said the winner will get a 1,500 baht prize.

621
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,240
- I’ll do it. - I’ll do it.

622
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,440
Why don’t give him a sentimental gift?

623
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,480
Even when ten years pass and he sees the gift, he’ll still think of you.

624
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Som-O, do you know how much the prize means to Khao?

625
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,840
Why are you telling me this?

626
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,400
Are you studying in the science program?

627
00:44:59,160 --> 00:44:59,800
Yes.

628
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,600
I guess I’ll see you around.

629
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,200
Yes.

630
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,840
I have a favor to ask you.

631
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,000
I’m going in.

632
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,320
Bye

633
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,280
Bye.

634
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,600
I flew back to sort out Chadjen’s living situation.

635
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,680
Otherwise, I wouldn’t come back.

What? Who came by?

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,040
That bastard is searching this whole place to catch us.

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,510
Hey, you'd better stay put and hide in there. Got it?

13
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,390
Damn it!

14
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,760
I'm sorry. I was browsing and...

00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,040
Let me do it.

No, it's okay.

18
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,340
I'll look through the document and contact you.

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,100

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,080
Okay.

28
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,670

- Okay.

00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,790
Gosh, I almost missed you.

30
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,470
It's getting late. Let me drive you back.

31
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,220
- It's okay.
- Come on.

32
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,960
Refusing too much isn't polite, either.

33
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,850
I'm worried.

34
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,540
Shall we?

35
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,990
Thank you for driving me home.

36
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,150
Ms. Kim.

37
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,760
Yes.

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,080
By chance...

39
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,660
did you see it?

00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,990
Pardon?

41
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,450
I'm sorry.

42
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,030
I didn't mean to see it, but...

43
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,040
I saw the limited-edition Camille piece I've never seen before.

44
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,230
I'm sorry.

45
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,980

Hey, Yoon Bok.

49
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,830
Me?

50
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,990
I stopped by Seongsan Hall, and I'm on my way home.

00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,300
- Teacher.
- Are you okay?

76
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,710
Yes, I am okay.

77
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,670
I didn't know Mr. Lee was like that.

78
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,840
I am glad nothing happened.

79
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,110
By the way, where is Hong Hak?

00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,020
Hong Hak?

81
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,640
He said he couldn't come home due to a webtoon meeting.

82
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,770
Pardon?

83
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,860
You mean you are here by yourself?

84
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,380
Yes.

85
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,670
This is no good. I think I should stay by your side.

86
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,910
- What?
- If you let me,

87
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,840
I will stay here tonight.

88
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,240
You're sleeping here?

89
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,090
Oh, yes.

90
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,470
Of course...

91
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,620
I'll allow it.

92
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,430
Willingly...

93
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,680
Relax, then.

94
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,300
Relax.

95
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,830
Okay. Have a relaxing time, Teacher.

96
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,330
Okay.

97
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,690
Gosh, were you awake?

98
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,710
How come you are not sleeping, Teacher?

99
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,750
Well, I couldn't sleep.

100
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,560
You cannot sleep?

101
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,600
No.

102
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,640
If so,

103
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,740
have a seat here.

104
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,480
- Should I?
- Yes.

105
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:40,240
I will tell you a story until you get sleepy.

106
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,990
Story?

107
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:49,230
It is a story from the book I used to read whenever I could not sleep.

108
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,470
Confucius' disciple, Zai Yu once said...

109
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,900
"Fortune comes from frugal places,

110
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,050
virtue comes from humility,

111
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,450
principle comes from ease,

112
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:19,740
and life comes from brightness."

113
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,190
What a nice saying.

114
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,530
"Do not refuse what comes naturally,

115
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:35,860
do not chase what is in the past,

116
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,530
do not anticipate what is yet to come,

117
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,140
and do not dwell on what is in the past."

118
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,280
"Only protect what is right...

119
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,340
and do not fool your heart.

120
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,200
Beware and...

121
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,630
beware again."

122
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,870
I'm home.

123
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,020
Noona...

124
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,270
I had a crazy nightmare just now.

125
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,620
You and my friend Yoon Bok-

126
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,870
Watch what you say.

127
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,240
What?

128
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,670
We're...

129
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,310
dating.

130
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,870
I need a place to stay.

131
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,720
What? CEO Lee Joon Ho?

132
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,240
Is he the one who hurt you last time, too?

133
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,130
I didn't think he'd be like that.

134
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,050
For that reason...

135
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,550
we should hire someone else to do the catering.

136
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,090
Is there a place you have in mind?

137
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,720
How about we ask the people of Seongsan Village?

138
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,800
To highlight the fact that we are collaborating with Seongsan Village.

139
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,380
That sounds great.

140
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,790
Why don't you make it happen, Hong Do Kim?

141
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,200
Okay.

142
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,160
Young Master, I found the car.

143
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,500
Hey! Are you kidding me?

144
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,100
What should we do now?

145
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,030
We should wait for fish since we threw a net.

146
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:12,680
I will meet Yeojudaek tomorrow, just in case.

147
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,580
My gosh!

148
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,130
You scared the hell out of me.

149
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,530
I will take this.

150
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,600
This goes to the Master's room, right?

151
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,440
Are you trying to get caught?

152
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,320
- Give that to me.
- Come on.

153
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,040
Don't worry about a thing.

154
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,530
I'll drop it off instantly like a wind.

155
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,720
Shoo!

156
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,690
Shoo!

157
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,600
Aigoo, seriously...

158
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,300
There.

159
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,780
Aigoo, there are a lot of treasures here.

160
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,700
There's a rock, too.

161
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,280
Wow, there's a bonsai, too.

162
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,340
The thief made his way into my bedroom.

163
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,310
He must be someone around me.

164
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,210
Who would do such a thing?

165
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,480
What is this?

166
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,390
Who are you?

167
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,400
I am considering supporting you to become

168
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,200
the Seongsan Village's leader.

169
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,120
If it was not for Se Ryeong and Yoon Bok's marriage...

170
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,000
My neck...

171
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,160
Tell the truth.

172
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,990
Who are you?

173
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,580
Me?

174
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,970
I'm Kim Chil Bok.

175
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,040
Do you work for Gamjjok?

176
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,500
No, no.

177
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:14,250
The young master of this family told me to hide here.

178
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,280
Yoon Bok did?

179
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,780
It's because I...

180
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:27,240
saw something I shouldn't have seen.

181
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,250
Since I might get killed,

182
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:38,500
the Young Master hid me here as some sort of a h-hidden card, I guess?

183
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,540
Do you expect me to believe you?

184
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,650
What he said is true.

185
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,970
Young Master.

186
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,420
This is the key chain attached to the village storage key.

187
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:01,380
That man from earlier saw Gamjjok with this key.

188
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,090
This is your father's belonging. How-

189
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,240
We could find out once we catch Gamjjok.

190
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,090
I thought he was already caught.

191
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,430
Grandfather, to be honest,

192
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,850
the real Gamjjok is someone else.

193
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,560
What did you say?

194
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,710
I told you to be careful.

195
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,810
Eat slowly. You might get an upset stomach.

196
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,150
- Water.
- No.

197
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,870
- D-Dongchimi. Give me dongchimi.
- Geez.

198
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,670
- Dongchimi!
- Hold on.

199
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,020
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

200
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,540
Young Master.

201
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:06,560
Aigoo, Young Master. Why do you look thinner every time I see you?

202
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,430
Are you eating well?

203
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:12,710
Do not worry about me. You make sure to eat well.

204
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,880
I cannot eat more than I already do.

205
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,730
Is everything okay with you?

206
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,410
Not much is going on with me.

207
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,910
Is Joon Ho doing well?

208
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,390
I would not know.

209
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,230
He has never been one to show affection and stay in touch.

210
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,750
Teacher!

211
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,100
Gosh, Yoon Bok.

212
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,680
What brings you here?

213
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,500
I came to see your grandfather regarding the fashion show.

214
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,600
If so, let us go back together.

215
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,920
I will wait until you are done.

216
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,170
Really?

217
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,480
Should we get something tasty on the way back?

218
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,580
Yes, let us.

219
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,520
Hello.

220
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,500
[Expected Benefits of Seongsan Residents Catering for the Fashion Show]

221
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,780
Let me discuss it with the villagers.

222
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,260
Thank you in advance.

223
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,220
Your name is...

224
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,160
Kim Hong Do, did you say?

225
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,240
Yes.

226
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,630
I heard you have been very helpful to my grandson.

227
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,920
Thank you.

228
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,580
Please don't mention it.

229
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,950
Yoon Bok has been helping me more.

230
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,520
I do not know how this might sound,

231
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,350
but Yoon Bok will come back to the village.

232
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,830
The deeper the feelings, the more you would get hurt.

233
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:19,600
So, sharing feelings just enough to manage would be good for both of you.

234
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,010
I understand what you mean.

235
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,840
But...

236
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,740
I hope you let Yoon Bok decide that.

237
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,400
No matter what he decides, I want to honor it

238
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,230
as long as he'd be happy.

239
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,760
Did I make a mistake?

240
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,440
No, right?

241
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,980
I did the right thing for Yoon Bok.

242
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,590
Yes, good job. Good job.

243
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,400
Or not?

244
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,620
I don't know.

245
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,370
Did the conversation go well?

246
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,300
Yes, of course.

247
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,280
What should we eat?

248
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,200
I would like anything you crave.

249
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,230
Really? How about...

250
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,790
so-tteok-so-tteok* at a rest stop?
(Sausages and rice cake on a stick)

251
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,660
You've been to a rest stop, right?

252
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,480
Yes, I think I have seen one passing by.

253
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,820
Really? Did you try anything?

254
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,970
I want to protect her even if it means giving up everything.

255
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,810
No matter what he decides, I want to honor it

256
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,340
as long as he'd be happy.

257
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,220
[You got a new message]

258
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,250
[When will we make a deal? I can't wait any longer.]

259
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,130
[Call me now. Why don't you respond?]

260
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,060
[We're both finished if this deal doesn't happen]

261
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,990
[I'll choose the location and get back to you]

262
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,290
What did you just say?

263
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:10,130
You will withdraw the wedding proposal? What nonsense is this?

264
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,470
I rushed things without knowing how determined Yoon Bok was.

265
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,700
- I am sorry.
- Sir!

266
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,390
Let us take time to reconsider the marriage.

267
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,450
I will not just sit and take it.

268
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,040
I did not expect to hear from you.

269
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,970
Yes, let me hear what you have to say.

270
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,440
It will help you greatly to get what you want.

271
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,690
Hong Do Kim?

272
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,490
Yes.

273
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,470
I got a call from Seongsan Village.

274
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:06,140
They agreed to do the catering.

275
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,150
- Good work.
- Thank you.

276
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,020
Let's see what you have here.

277
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,680
Okay.

278
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,430
- Let's switch the lining to silk.
- Okay.

279
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:22,190
- The texture only you can feel gives satisfaction.
- Okay.

280
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,900
I think it'd be perfect if you changed just that.

281
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,490
Thank you.

282
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,200
Here.

283
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,670
I'll let you get back to it.

284
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,110
Thank you.

285
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,950
Let's go, guys. Coffee is on me today.

286
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,070
- Really?
- Yes.

287
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:42,180
Yay! You're the best, Sunbaenim.

288
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,230
I can't drink coffee.

289
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,410
You can order something else. What would you like?

290
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,440
Caffeine doesn't let me sleep at night.

291
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,200
I'll have a caramel java chip shake with extra caramel, whipped cream,

292
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,100
ice, cinnamon, chocolate chips, and java chips.

293
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,720
Okay.

294
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,480
Let's go.

295
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,870
Hong Do Kim, this is...

296
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,480
Why aren't you working?

297
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,170
Will you let the models go on stage

298
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:16,210
wearing only undergarments at the fashion show?

299
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,960
We'll take a quick coffee break and come back.

300
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,620
Coffee?

301
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,470
Should I join you, too?

302
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,860
Pardon?

303
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,790
I'll pay.

304
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,280
Really?

305
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,040
I'll get you cakes, too.

306
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,800
- You can have two glasses.
- Really?

307
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,930
Let's go, let's go. Yes, yes,. Let's go.

308
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,420
Coffee. Let's go!

309
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,920
Where are you?

310
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,360
[I'm almost there]

311
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,800
Come to the second floor.

312
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,700
You'll get a lesser sentence if you work with us.

313
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,590
What happened?

314
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,740
Go check upstairs.

315
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,160
Okay.

316
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,750
He could not have gone far.

317
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,130
He must be nearby.

318
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,490
Officer Lee, block the entrance and check the back.

319
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,050
Detective Kim, join them. Detective Jang will come with me.

320
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,630
- Let's get moving!
- Yes!

321
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,050
What brings you here at this hour?

322
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,560
Pichohye is a part of the tradition

323
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,150
Seongsan's artisans have been protecting for a long time.

324
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,810
How dare you make it look French?

325
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:37,490
You deceived the villagers and sold out our tradition!

326
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:40,080
What kind of nonsense is this?

327
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,990
The whole world discovered our almost forgotten tradition.

328
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,310
We should be glad about that.

329
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:49,590
The entire profit from the pichohye sales was donated for the return of cultural heritage.

330
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,460
If so...

331
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,600
what is this?

332
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,020
You are trying to make a profit

333
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,220
by scheming with this woman!

334
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,340
The fashion show is not going to happen.

335
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,140
If this turns out to be true,

336
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,860
you will have to step down as the village leader.

337
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,470
Your Excellency Lee!

338
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,930
Your Excellency Lee!

339
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,340
My goodness! Master!

340
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,090
Aigoo!

341
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,010
Master! Aigoo...

342
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,490
What is going on?

343
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,340
What? Grandfather is...

344
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,050
Young Master.

345
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,110
What happened?

346
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,050
You have no idea.

347
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,800
The village elders came and had a huge argument.

348
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,260
I will stay with Grandfather.

349
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,520
You can go and rest.

350
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,230
Okay.

351
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,940
What? They canceled the fashion show?

352
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:47,780
For some reason, the village committee called first thing in the morning.

353
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,620
Let's go.

354
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,830
What?

355
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,680
Let's go and find out what's going on for ourselves!

356
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,630
Stay in bed longer.

357
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,580
I am okay.

358
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,710
It is nothing.

359
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:53,290
Yeojudaek contacted you for no reason.

360
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:03,360
It looks like they got the wrong idea after seeing that.

361
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,230
Wrong idea? What wrong idea?

362
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:10,990
What's going on? Why are you canceling the fashion show?

363
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,710
Well, it's all true.
[Camille's pichohye sweeps the world]

364

Step outside for a moment.

365
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,750
Was the fashion show canceled?

366
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,480
Yes.

367
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,230
I am sorry.

368
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,440
I am to blame for everything.

369
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,700
Who exactly...

370
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,920
Why are they bringing up the past and causing this ruckus?

371
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,670
I will try to fix it. Please give me some time.

372
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:56,450
The village would have been in trouble if it was not for you, Your Excellency Lee.

373
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,760
I know.

374
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:04,860
It turns out you were the true leader of Seongsan.

375
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:09,060
It is all thanks to you.

376
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,360
Are you in there?

377
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,240
Come in.

378
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:32,940
What brings you here?

379
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,310
Why are you taking things so far?

380
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:44,160
Of course, it is for the sake of the village.

381
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,310
The village?

382
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:49,440
Not because I withdrew the wedding proposal?

383
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,440
The people have already turned against you.

384
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,650
It might look better if you stepped down yourself

385
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:00,920
since it has come to this.

386
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,280
I am not interested in doing so at all.

387
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,850
I will make sure to reveal the truth

388
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:10,050
and turn everything back.

389
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,870
Is this happening because of my marriage?

390
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,420
Are you in there?

391
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,610

Please...

393
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,060
Please talk to me for a moment.

394
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:39,790
I should have told you this a long time ago.

395
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,890
It took too long.

396
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:48,060
I am aware of your feelings, but unfortunately...

397
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:54,090
I cannot reciprocate.

398
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:58,830
How could you be so cruel?

399
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:02,880
I understand how sad and angry you are,

400
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,990
but you should move on before we hurt each other more.

401
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:10,670
What am I supposed to do, then?

402
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,890
I am to blame for everything.

403
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:18,710
Do not worry about what others think...

404
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:23,750
and blame me for everything.

405
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,260
I sincerely...

406
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:34,490
hope you meet a good person who understands your gentle heart

407
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,340
and be happy.

408
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:17,770
A famous doctor in Mt. Jiri gathered this ginseng extract drop by drop.

409

00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:21,960
Thank you.

411
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,910
I will keep my memory with you here

412
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,700
and forget it as if it never happened.

413
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,200
So...

414
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,880
please forget me and live well.

415
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:54,930
I think this happened to you because I sent you the key.

416
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:56,290
I'm sorry.

417
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:59,150
Don't think that.

418
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,070
Although things turned out this way,

419
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:06,980
I was happy to see you again.

420
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,040
Happy, my foot.

421
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,850
Whenever I thought of you,

422
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:16,950
I remembered the day we broke up, giving you this colored pencil.

423
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:19,470
It made me feel bad.

424
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,470
I know that you had no choice

425
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,820
but to make that decision then.

426
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,490
I would've made that decision, too.

427
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:36,250
So, don't dwell on it anymore.

428
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,020
Where did Yoon Bok go?

429
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,650
There you are.

430
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,390
Teacher, what brings you here?

431
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:33,180
I couldn't sleep.

432
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,390
I was looking for you, wondering what you were doing.

433
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,330
How is your grandfather? Is he okay?

434
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,650
How is Ms. Camille?

435
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,220
Don't worry so much.

436
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,280
Everything will be okay.

437
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,960
You do not have to worry, either.

438
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,550
I will make sure to fix this.

439
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:44,130
I'll take care of things in Seoul.

440
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:47,580
I'll join you as soon as things get sorted out here.

441
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,160
Safe travels.

442
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,300
My gosh, Excellency Lee is so thoughtful.

443
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:56,020
- He is the only one who thinks of us.
- Yes.

I will step down.

Are you okay?

477
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,610
How nice and quiet.

To be honest, I didn't think the situation would change so quickly.

486

This is all thanks to the old servant of the Woorim family-

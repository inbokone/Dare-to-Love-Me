00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,004
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL
AND ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, GROUPS,

2
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,505
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA
ARE HISTORICALLY IRRELEVANT.

3
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,382
ANIMALS WERE FILMED IN COMPLIANCE
WITH THE PRODUCTION GUIDELINES.

4
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,097
Be careful.

5
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,917
Just a moment.

6
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,507
Yoon-bok!

7
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,060
I heard from Yi-bok.

8
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:46,397
Your mother really wants to see you.

9
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,695
I felt bad seeing her like that.

10
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,073
And I know it's none of my business, but--

11
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,325
Yes, it is none of your business.

12
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,787
If you make decisions
on matters you know nothing about

13
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,331
and force me to do as you say,

14
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:08,253
I cannot obey you,
even if you are my master.

15
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,759
But you've made it all the way here.

16
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,719
You might as well--

17
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,806
I am here for you, not for that person.

18
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,769
Please do not

19
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,522
meddle in my affairs anymore.

20
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,235
I will get going.

21
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,362
Yoon-bok.

22
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,536
You can't keep those walls up forever.

23
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,502
Are you going to live your whole life

24
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,380
shutting down people who try to get close?

25
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,549
That suits me.

26
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,550
Does it really?

27
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,428
Does turning away the people
who love and care for you

28
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,597
really suit you?

29
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,641
You can't live life on your own.

30
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,561
Sharing your worries with others,
taking care of each other,

31
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,770
and trying to empathize.

32
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,941
Withstanding all of those things
and living together

33
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,526
is what happiness is about.

34
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,404
Togetherness is happiness?

35
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,657
I almost believed that to be true.

36
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,951
Actually,

37
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,287
I wanted it to be true.

38
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,835
However, that is not
all that matters to me.

39
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,631
I have duties and things to protect,

40
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,884
and I must not stray from my path.

41
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,179
I cannot let the false joy of togetherness

42
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,765
distract me from my duties.

43
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,727
I have granted you
three wishes as promised.

44
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,646
So please,

45
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,941
leave me be now.

46
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,745
Mother,

47
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,790
are you going somewhere?

48
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,212
Take me with you.

49
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,051
…seven,

50
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,723
eight,

51
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,183
nine…

52
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,825
Mom!

53
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,036
- Mom, what's wrong?
- Is everything okay?

54
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,495
Mom!

55
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,706
Mom!

56
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,000
What's wrong, Mom?

57
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,315
<i>Does it really?</i>

58
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,360
<i>Does turning away the people
who love and care for you</i>

59
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,612
<i>really suit you?</i>

60
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:15,416
It might be time to start preparing
for your final goodbyes.

61
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,326
EPISODE 8
LATE REGRETS

62
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,291
{\an8}It hurts.

63
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,253
{\an8}If you cannot even bear this pain,

64
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,796
{\an8}why did you jump in?

65
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,759
{\an8}Such actions come naturally
to a strong man.

66
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,807
{\an8}I risked everything
to make the gamble of a lifetime.

67
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,392
{\an8}I went all in on you, Yun-a.

68
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,018
{\an8}Why are you so reckless?

69
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,687
{\an8}Because

70
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,314
{\an8}I want to do it again.

71
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,691
{\an8}What?

72
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,279
{\an8}What did you say?

73
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,114
{\an8}I do not think so!

74
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:32,410
{\an8}Even doing it once
has messed up my head so much,

75
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,870
{\an8}and you want to do it again?

76
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,872
I'm talking about webcomics.

77
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,249
Oh, that is what you meant.

78
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,877
That is exactly how I understood it.

79
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,129
I was not thinking of something else.

80
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,968
Of course, I want to do that again too.

81
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,389
But I'm willing to wait
until you're ready.

82
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,767
I have no idea what you mean.

83
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,438
I've thought a lot

84
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,523
about giving up on webcomics,

85
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,609
but I just can't seem to do it.

86
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,153
I want to give it another go,

87
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,072
but I can't do it alone.

88
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,163
I need your help.

89
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,166
Yun-a,

90
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,668
please be my muse.

91
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,546
"Muse"?

92
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,555
So I turned to this huge man

93
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,974
who was at least
three times bigger than me,

94
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:42,188
spun 540 degrees in the air
and hit him with my powerful kicks.

95
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,357
With just a bit of exaggeration,

96
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,485
he ended up flying backward
and slamming into a wall.

97
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,656
Now, 540 degrees would be…

98
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,034
So…

99
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,619
Watch me.

100
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,136
Goodness,

101
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,764
why do you have so much luggage?

102
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,393
You could've told me
I'd be staying somewhere tiny.

103
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:26,649
It's your first day here,
so I steamed some potatoes for you.

104
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,401
Have some when you're hungry.

105
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,320
There's a furnace and some pots in there,

106
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,614
so make sure to keep yourself fed.

107
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,454
Where's the nearest grocery store?

108
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,748
Grocery store?

109
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,709
Oh, the market?

110
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:48,462
Just keep walking toward the east
for about half an hour

111
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,798
and you can buy what you need.

112
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,010
In the case of an emergency,

113
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,388
walk half an hour in that direction
where the cuckoo is singing.

114
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,975
I live at Woorim Residence,
and that's where it is.

115
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,310
Cuckoo?

116
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,396
Is this the cuckoo?

117
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,107
No, this is an owl.

118
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,859
The cuckoo goes, "Cu-ckoo!"

119
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:17,033
Anyway, I just need to stay here
and convince the villagers, right?

120
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,451
That's right.

121
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,287
But it won't be so easy staying here.

122
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,039
Good luck.

123
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,267
The air is so clear.

124
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,062
Shall I go for a walk?

125
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,482
How do you think she will do?

126
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,025
I am not sure.

127
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:55,905
What worries me is whether the villagers
will warm up to her.

128
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,295
All right.

129
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,214
So the grocery store is this way.

130
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,099
Hello.

131
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,564
What a horrific sight.

132
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,073
Hello, everyone.

133
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,372
TEA

134
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,698
What would you like?

135
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,199
Do you have coffee?

136
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,367
Coffee?

137
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,244
We do.

138
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,497
{\an8}GABAE

139
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,582
Where is it?

140
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,542
It is written right there.

141
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,005
Are you blind or something?

142
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,134
Anyway, I'd like a cup of coffee.

143
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,762
A cappuccino with steamed milk, please.

144
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,639
Cappu what?

145
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,475
Cappuccino.

146
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,644
Oh, I guess you don't sell those.

147
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,146
I'll have a regular coffee.

148
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,817
We are more known for <i>nokcha</i>
than <i>gabae</i>, you know?

149
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,365
<i>Nokcha</i>?

150
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,951
Oh, you mean green tea.

151
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,287
I'm not really into…

152
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,999
If the majority of the villagers
agree to your event,

153
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,044
only then will it happen.

154
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:16,962
All right.

155
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,756
I'd like a cup of <i>nokcha.</i>

156
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,942
It's so bitter.

157
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,490
Excuse me?

158
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,033
What is it?

159
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,786
Could you get me some cold milk
and a container with a lid?

160
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,664
And some sugar
and a spoon while you're at it.

161
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,438
That's more like it.

162
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,666
What's the matter?
How did I insult your establishment?

163
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,625
Get lost!

164
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,756
- But…
- Where is she?

165
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:48,429
- Jeez!
- Oh my gosh! What's going on?

166
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,431
Unbelievable.

167
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,115
<i>I have duties and things to protect,</i>

168
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,367
<i>and I must not stray from my path.</i>

169
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,661
<i>I cannot let the false joy of togetherness</i>

170
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,955
<i>distract me from my duties.</i>

171
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,417
You can't keep those walls up forever.

172
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,587
Are you going to live your whole life

173
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,465
shutting down people who try to get close?

174
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,686
<i>Yoon-bok,</i>

175
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,356
<i>Mom doesn't have long left to live.</i>

176
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,786
Are you awake, Young Master?

177
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,623
Young Master?

178
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,382
What?

179
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,417
ROOM 206
PI ◯-WON

180
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,629
You avoided me
every time I tried to find you.

181
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,049
And now this is how you avoid me.

182
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,641
I am here to ask you a question.

183
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,811
Why…

184
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,149
did you abandon me?

185
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,369
Do you know how long I waited for you?

186
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,041
I waited every second of every day.

187
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,423
And yet you did not return.

188
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,677
Now here you are in this state.

189
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,895
I cannot forgive you, Mother.

190
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,898
As such,

191
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,192
this time…

192
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,697
I will abandon you.

193
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,527
It's busy as hell today.

194
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,820
Where's the part-timer?

195
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,989
I don't know.
I think she just skipped work.

196
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,085
This kitchen looks like a dump!

197
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,381
- I'm sorry.
- Clean it up.

198
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,382
Yes, sir.

199
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,475
<i>I won't be able to work for a few days.</i>

200
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,602
Is something wrong?

201
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,437
<i>It's a family matter.</i>

202
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,147
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

203
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,044
Yi-bok,

204
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,338
I'm here.

205
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,674
Thank you.

206
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,818
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

207
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,367
Did you pull an all-nighter, Young Master?

208
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,330
This part of the delivery truck's route
has no CCTV coverage.

209
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,417
We must find out what happened there.

210
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,961
Understood.

211
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,986
Gosh, when did it get so chilly?

212
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,281
Jeez, it's cold.

213
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:56,977
What's this?

214
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,147
It's no big deal.

215
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,859
I got it while waiting for you
when we were in Seoul.

216
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,237
Well, what is it?

217
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,321
Stop right there.

218
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,368
Take a look once I'm in my room.

219
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,540
Why is he acting so strange?

220
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,384
Goodness me.

221
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,241
These are useless.

222
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,795
Useless?

223
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,008
Useless…

224
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,441
These are so warm.

225
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,449
- Lady Yeoju.
- Yes?

226
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,790
Deliver this to Lord Lee.

227
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,377
Could this be…

228
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,128
Inform Yoon-bok as well.

229
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,339
Yes, my lord.

230
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,556
What?

231
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,725
What has arrived?

232
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:05,814
Father.

233
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,691
Father.

234
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:11,236
Is it true that Yoon-bok's marriage letter
has arrived?

235
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,571
We must decide on a fortunate date.

236
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,375
Father!

237
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,671
Young Master.

238
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,256
What is it?

239
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,301
Lady Yeoju has just sent word.

240
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,969
Lord Shin…

241
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:40,640
has sent Lady Se-ryung's family
a marriage letter.

242
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,185
Marriage letter?

243
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,980
Are you getting married?

244
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,190
After what I had told him,

245
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,652
he still made my decision for me.

246
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,990
I guess this is what you call
an arranged marriage.

247
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,702
Will you go through with it?

248
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,582
I cannot avoid it,
no matter how much I want to.

249
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:17,093
I'm so worried about
how Camille's doing over there.

250
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,762
I can't even contact her.

251
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:23,183
That woman needs
her two cups of cappuccino every day.

252
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,018
Seeing as how she hasn't contacted us,

253
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,561
she must be doing all right.

254
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,981
They say no news is good news.

255
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,943
YI-BOK

256
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,528
Please excuse me.

257
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,574
Hey, Yi-bok.

258
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,126
Will you spend the night
in the village again?

259
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,754
I will discuss the marriage letter
with Grandfather

260
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,048
and spend the night
training my swordsmanship.

261
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:20,657
Hello?

262
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,742
<i>Are you Ms. Pi Hye-won's son?</i>

263
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,371
<i>Your mother has passed away.</i>

264
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:37,966
{\an8}THE LATE PI HYE-WON

265
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,885
{\an8}My poor mom.

266
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,216
I'm glad you came.

267
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,098
I am only here to do my duty.

268
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,392
There is nothing more to it.

269
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,230
Wait, Yoon-bok.

270
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,399
Please stay here.

271
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,692
I'll be right back.

272
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:31,871
Yoon-bok.

273
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:37,877
Hello, Master.

274
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,965
Have you eaten yet? Come with me.

275
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:42,882
No, thank you.

276
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:44,801
I am fine.

277
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,059
What is this?

278
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,896
Mom wanted you to have it.

279
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,028
Please take a look.

280
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,781
And…

281
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,868
thank you for coming.

282
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,749
<i>Mom wanted you to have it.</i>

283
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,883
<i>My dear son Yoon-bok.</i>

284
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:18,181
<i>I'm sorry for leaving you</i>

285
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,016
<i>and hurting you.</i>

286
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,980
<i>I know you can't forgive
your foolish mother</i>

287
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,984
<i>but think of this as my last wish,</i>

288
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,029
<i>and please listen to what I have to say.</i>

289
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,450
<i>I married your father</i>

290
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,994
<i>at the age of 20.</i>

291
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,749
<i>It was a marriage
arranged a long time ago,</i>

292
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,835
<i>so I had no other choice.</i>

293
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,962
There you go.

294
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,299
There.

295
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,677
Come here.

296
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,475
Peekaboo!

297
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:04,936
Peekaboo!

298
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,562
Is he not adorable?

299
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,441
Yoon-bok's so cute, Mom.

300
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:14,028
<i>I was the happiest when you were born,</i>

301
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,531
<i>my precious and lovely son.</i>

302
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:23,079
As the heir of the Woorim family,
you are to lead the village eventually.

303
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,957
But instead of studying
the literary and martial arts,

304
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,709
you are wasting your time
with these foolish endeavors!

305
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,755
How dare you shed tears?

306
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:38,219
<i>Whenever I saw the heavy burden
on your small shoulders,</i>

307
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,848
<i>my heart broke into a million pieces.</i>

308
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,308
Again with that nonsense.

309
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,437
How many times have I said
the village gate must not be opened?

310
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,107
Father,

311
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,443
at least the children
should have the freedom

312
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,238
to choose how they want to live.

313
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,449
I cannot let them live like me.

314
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:07,415
Tradition will eventually deteriorate
if we leave it as it is.

315
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,335
I must agree with her on this matter,

316
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,588
- so I ask you to--
- How dare you!

317
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,424
How can you say such a thing

318
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,218
as the eldest son of our family
and the heir to the village?

319
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,721
Are you out of your mind?!

320
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,433
What a fool.

321
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,615
After long, constant persuasion,

322
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,701
your grandfather allowed the village gate

323
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,871
to finally be opened to outsiders.

324
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,507
Reporting live in Seongsan--

325
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,592
Fire!

326
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,720
Fire!

327
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,481
I see the fire!

328
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,617
<i>However, an unexpected tragedy struck.</i>

329
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,622
Because of you,
we opened the village gate.

330
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,165
And because of that…

331
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,961
my son died.

332
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:39,548
You killed my son, Sa-do.

333
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,552
Leave immediately.

334
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,765
Father.

335
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,309
How could you--

336
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:54,063
I cannot trust that you will keep
my grandchildren safe.

337
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,566
I want you out of my sight,
so leave immediately!

338
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:02,363
How could you tear me away

339
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,117
from my own living children?

340
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,538
Please let me take my children with me.

341
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,582
That is ridiculous.

342
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,544
Do you wish to decimate

343
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,171
the Woorim family line?

344
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,343
I will die if you want me to die.

345
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,722
I would rather follow
the fate of my husband

346
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:32,184
than leave my children behind.

347
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,480
Please, Father.

348
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,940
Yoon-bok

349
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,943
has a duty to the village.

350
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,074
Father!

351
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,244
Please show me mercy.

352
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,247
You cannot do this to me.

353
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,791
I will show you mercy

354
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,336
and allow you to take Yi-bok.

355
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,172
You are never to look for Yoon-bok

356
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,549
or even think about him.

357
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,470
Make that vow to yourself.

358
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,821
{\an8}VISITORS ARE NOT ALLOWED PAST THIS POINT

359
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,657
<i>I had no choice but to leave you</i>

360
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,703
<i>and take your sister with me.</i>

361
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,793
Just once.

362
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,212
Please let me see Yoon-bok once.

363
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,172
I am deeply sorry.

364
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,675
Lord Shin has strictly barred you
from entering.

365
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,791
Do not come here anymore.

366
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:04,879
Father.

367
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,590
I cannot find it in myself to forgive you

368
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,758
when I think of my poor son,

369
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:14,013
but I cannot deny
your maternal love for your own son.

370
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,975
Once Yoon-bok
takes on his role as the heir,

371
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,312
I shall call you in then.

372
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,229
Therefore,

373
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,191
do not weaken his heart
until that moment comes.

374
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,317
Promise me

375
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,819
you will go somewhere far away
as if you don't exist.

376
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,362
But…

377
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,491
If you refuse to accept my terms,

378
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,536
do not ever dream of seeing him again.

379
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,916
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

380
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,710
<i>in order to have you back…</i>

381
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,839
<i>I had to lose you first.</i>

382
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,633
Enjoy.

383
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,761
Welcome.

384
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:58,098
Do you know someone who goes by
the first name Hye-won and last name Pi?

385
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,852
There's a boy in a school uniform
and a traditional hat looking for you.

386
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,480
Tell him I'm not here.

387
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,065
Where are you going?

388
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,186
Yoon-bok,

389
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,814
I'm so sorry.

390
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,401
It's my fault.

391
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,071
It's all my fault.

392
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,908
Yoon-bok.

393
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,496
Yoon-bok…

394
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,543
<i>Ultimately,</i>

395
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,797
<i>I paid the price for abandoning you.</i>

396
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,178
She's survived the critical stage

397
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,097
but she's in dire condition.

398
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,564
<i>What scared me more</i>

399
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,068
<i>wasn't death, but the possibility
that I could die without asking you</i>

400
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,362
<i>for forgiveness.</i>

401
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,906
Yi-bok.

402
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,785
Please find Yoon-bok.

403
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,208
And when you do,

404
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,086
stay by his side.

405
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,091
I will.

406
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,094
Even if he doesn't want me to,

407
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,847
I'll stay right next to him.

408
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,156
<i>You don't have to forgive me.</i>

409
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:24,536
<i>But I ask that you don't push away</i>

410
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,122
<i>your one and only sister.</i>

411
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,127
<i>My dear son,</i>

412
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,588
<i>Yoon-bok.</i>

413
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:40,260
<i>I wish I could see your face
one last time.</i>

414
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,685
I cannot forgive you, Mother.

415
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:50,687
As such,

416
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,773
this time…

417
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,570
I will abandon you.

418
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:07,204
<i>How hard must it have been for you?</i>

419
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:11,792
<i>How lonely must you have been?</i>

420
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,172
<i>I will take to my grave</i>

421
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,384
<i>all of your pain and loneliness.</i>

422
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,180
<i>Break down the walls
you've built because of me,</i>

423
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,851
<i>love freely,</i>

424
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:33,021
<i>and live your life doing what you love.</i>

425
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:39,194
<i>I don't even deserve
to call your name, my Yoon-bok.</i>

426
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,739
<i>I failed you as a mother,</i>

427
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:47,786
<i>but my heart has always been with you.</i>

428
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:51,748
<i>I love you,</i>

429
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,501
<i>my son.</i>

430
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,006
<i>No…</i>

431
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,176
<i>I loved you.</i>

432
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,692
Mother…

433
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,318
Camille is staying in the village?

434
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,989
I may be the head of the village,

435
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:10,661
but I cannot force the villagers
to open the gate.

436
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,706
If she considers this village

437
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,709
simply as the backdrop
to a commercial event,

438
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,379
she will never be able to
convince the villagers.

439
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,965
That is why

440
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:26,301
I have given her the opportunity
to change their minds.

441
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,811
What are you doing, Young Master?

442
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,235
What do you think you are doing?

443
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,320
How could you?

444
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,783
Show some respect to our guest.

445
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,327
How could you lie to me?

446
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,455
You told me…

447
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,501
that my mother abandoned me.

448
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,090
Lord Shin,

449
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,384
I shall excuse myself.

450
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,562
What would have changed
if I had told you the truth?

451
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,986
You should have told the truth regardless.

452
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,948
Do you know how I felt then?

453
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,458
…ninety-nine…

454
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,339
It felt as if I was left alone
in this world.

455
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,635
I hoped it was a joke…

456
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,182
and spent every night counting.

457
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,856
When the people I loved the most

458
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,778
and the people
I thought loved me the most left…

459
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,366
I was unable to love

460
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,535
or trust anyone.

461
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,498
You are not the only one
who suffered from a loss.

462
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,083
I lost my son as well.

463
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,335
Is that why you took away
my mother and sister

464
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,838
when I had just lost my father?

465
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:32,594
You knew I was searching for my mother!

466
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,016
How could you be so heartless?

467
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,520
I thought it would weaken your mind.

468
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,646
As you know,

469
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,315
it is your fate to lead this--

470
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,817
Damn my fate!

471
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,741
I will give it up.

472
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,453
If my fate is to turn my back on my family

473
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:02,082
and not be with my mother
even during her last moments…

474
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:05,836
then I refuse that fate.

475
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:10,507
What do you mean, Young Master?

476
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,592
Your mother's last moments?

477
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,594
Don't tell me…

478
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,222
Not only was I absent as she passed,

479
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,685
but I resented my mother to the very end.

480
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,565
She had missed me so dearly.

481
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,360
I regret…

482
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,450
I regret everything so much.

483
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,622
I will not live like this any longer.

484
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,124
What…

485
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,752
do you mean?

486
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,378
I will break free!

487
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,214
I will no longer do anything

488
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,717
you have set for me to do,
be it upholding tradition,

489
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,680
leading the village,
or marrying who you want for me.

490
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,185
I shall listen to my mother

491
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,396
and do what I love

492
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,608
and live freely.

493
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,447
Young Master!

494
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:21,077
Goodness, Lord Shin!

495
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,239
I wonder if he's home.

496
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,830
Yoon-bok.

497
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:16,758
Wait.

498
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,097
Yoon-bok.

499
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,067
Are you home?

500
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,070
I'm coming in.

501
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,330
Yoon-bok?

502
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,011
Is he out somewhere?

503
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:17,193
MASTER KIM

504
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:39,966
Where has he gone without an umbrella?

505
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:19,339
Yes, Mom?

506
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,382
Jun-ho.

507
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,717
Please check on Young Master.

508
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,720
Yoon-bok?

509
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,182
Lady Pi has passed away.

510
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,852
<i>It's a family matter.</i>

511
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,313
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

512
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,801
{\an8}THE LATE PI HYE-WON

513
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,136
{\an8}Father!

514
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,599
Please show me mercy.

515
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:55,018
You are never to look for Yoon-bok

516
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,895
or even think about him.

517
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,735
<i>I did not know my harsh words</i>

518
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,697
<i>would become your reality.</i>

519
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,117
<i>You must have resented me</i>

520
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,412
<i>for taking you away</i>

521
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,332
<i>from your dear son.</i>

522
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,585
<i>I am sorry…</i>

523
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:23,922
<i>my dear daughter-in-law.</i>

524
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,725
<i>She has grown so much.</i>

525
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,212
Were you

526
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,714
waiting for me?

527
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,217
What? Well…

528
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,262
It's raining a lot, so I got worried.

529
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,433
I haven't been out for long.

530
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,942
You had a rough day, didn't you?
You should go rest.

531
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:50,693
Here, take this.

532
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,788
Take this so you don't catch a cold again.

533
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,878
I am all right.

534
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,256
I'll run ahead. Take your time, okay?

535
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,590
I'll get going then.

536
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,466
{\an8}THANK YOU TO LIM HO
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

537
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:18,364
{\an8}EPILOGUE

538
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,043
{\an8}Where was the bathroom again?

539
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:54,025
{\an8}Madam Yeoju!

540
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:56,861
{\an8}Madam Yeoju!

541
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:14,754
{\an8}Madam Yeoju!

542
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,389
{\an8}<i>Yoon-bok has changed.</i>

543
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:27,392
{\an8}<i>No way. Does he like me?</i>

544
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,227
{\an8}I do not agree.

545
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:32,230
{\an8}Those are actions
that can stem from admiration.

546
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:33,773
{\an8}<i>It means they have taken it the wrong way.</i>

547
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:38,319
{\an8}<i>Am I so in love with Yoon-bok
that I'm deluding myself?</i>

548
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,280
{\an8}Do not go.

549
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:46,369

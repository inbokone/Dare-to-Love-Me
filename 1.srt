1
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:10,983
(Have you ever run after someone for a really long time)

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,303
(that you start wondering if the reason you can’t catch up to them)

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,108
(is because their strides are much bigger than yours)

4
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:18,117
(or because they never really mean to wait for you at all?)

5
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:20,008
Hey, Chad.

6
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:34,659
Chad.

7
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:35,979
Chadjen.

8
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,368
What?

9
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:39,608
This is hardly a stroll.

10
00:00:39,724 --> 00:00:41,053
It’s like you’re walking away from me.

11
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,355
You still manage to catch up with me every time.

12
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:46,688
But it’s exhausting.

13
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:48,942
Do you have to be so cruel?

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,659
Are we still talking about the stroll?

15
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,022
We’re talking about my being in love with you.

16
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:12,805
(Chadjen.)

17
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:15,106
(How could you not know that all this time?)

18
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:19,314
(I just hope the answer is worth the long wait.)

19
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,170
A television drama adaptation from the original Chinese novel A Love So Beautiful written by Zhao Qianqian

20
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,970
14 YEARS AGO

21
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:58,423
(My name is Som-O.)

22
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:00,237
(I live in Ari.)

23
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:02,404
(Both of my parents work in public service.)

24
00:03:02,997 --> 00:03:05,200
(We’re not wealthy, but we’re not poor.)

25
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:07,829
(How do I say this…)

26
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,860
(Let’s just say we’re not struggling with anything.)

27
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:14,339
(Across the street from my house is where Chadjen lives.)

28
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,339
(We’ve known each other since we were kids)

29
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:18,607
(because we took the same school bus.)

30
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,625
Chadjen.

31
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:29,059
Come on in, Som.

32
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:32,962
Good morning, Aunt Aun.

33
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:35,607
Good morning, Little Som.

34
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,774
Did Chadjen get up yet?

35
00:03:37,995 --> 00:03:38,862
No.

36
00:03:39,272 --> 00:03:41,579
I’ll go and wake him up for you.

37
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:42,309
Alright.

38
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,281
(Look at him, Mr. Burden.)

39
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,880
(Now that I think about it, I wish I never met him at all.)

40
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:06,617
Chadjen, time to get up.

41
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,897
Chadjen.

42
00:04:09,546 --> 00:04:11,217
Chadjen!

43
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,398
It’s time to go to school.

44
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:22,398
Get in the shower.

45
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:32,007
(The two of us went to the same kindergarten and the same class.)

46
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:35,549
Oh, that’s the school bus, guys.

47
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,709
Time to go.

48
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,819
Chadjen, Som-O, have a good day.

49
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:39,912
Alright.

50
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,574
My mother said it’s not polite to eat while walking around.

51
00:04:47,594 --> 00:04:50,422
Did your mother also tell you that it’s not polite to shout at people?

52
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,765
But you wouldn’t wake up.

53
00:04:51,776 --> 00:04:53,749
Let’s just go to school.

54
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,010
10 YEARS LATER

55
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,250
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL

56
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,090
GRADE 10

57
00:05:06,102 --> 00:05:10,207
(10 years later, it’s he who has to wake me up.)

58
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:27,220
Wake up!

59
00:05:31,328 --> 00:05:33,306
Ugh, Chadjen!

60
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:36,211
Do you want to be late on your first day of school?

61
00:05:37,448 --> 00:05:38,260
I know that.

62
00:05:38,322 --> 00:05:39,697
Stop nitpicking me.

63
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:41,752
Get out of my way, you pest.

64
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,314
Go wait downstairs.

65
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:49,814
Go!

66
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:18,533
Thanks, dear.

67
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:20,065
Thank you.

68
00:06:23,736 --> 00:06:26,210
Oh, Chadjen, can I ask you something?

69
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,060
Yes?

70
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:30,656
Does Som have any new friends now that she’s in high school?

71
00:06:33,312 --> 00:06:34,656
I don’t really know.

72
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:39,408
Was there any guys hitting on our Som at the orientation?

73
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,882
I didn’t see anyone doing that.

74
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:45,019
Good to hear.

75
00:06:45,315 --> 00:06:47,737
You gotta be my eyes and ears, Chad.

76
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:50,109
Don’t let anyone mess with her.

77
00:06:51,002 --> 00:06:52,924
Everything’s fast and quick now.

78
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:55,120
But I believe something can wait.

79
00:06:57,145 --> 00:06:59,657
You’re speaking in riddles, dear.

80
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:01,502
It’s men’s talk.

81
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:04,561
I’m late. I’m so late.

82
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,456
How come you just came down here?

83
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:09,527
Not now, Dad. We’re going to be late.

84
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:11,005
Shall we?

85
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,703
Guys, I’m off. Bye.

86
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:15,312
Chad, don’t forget these.

87
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,173
You drink this every day, right?

88
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:19,709
Thank you.

89
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:21,037
Here.

90
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:30,551
Oh? Wasn’t it supposed to be for lunch?

91
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,499
It’s more refreshing in the afternoon, isn’t it?

92
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,397
Let’s just go. Hurry up.

93
00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:37,644
- Mom, Dad, bye. - Bye.

94
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,204
Som became a woman in a flash, didn't she?

95
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,128
A woman? No way.

96
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,817
She’s still a kid running around with Chadjen like she always has.

97
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,562
You’re impossible.

98
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:50,777
She’s still just a girl.

99
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:58,514
- Good morning. - Good morning.

100
00:07:58,663 --> 00:08:00,510
Very neat and proper uniform. Good

101
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:03,173
- Hello. - Hello.

102
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:06,706
Hello.

103
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:07,411
Good Morning.

104
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,859
- Morning! - Hi.

105
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,548
Oh, what’s the rush?

106
00:08:16,856 --> 00:08:17,656
Hello.

107
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:20,965
Here. Your glasses.

108
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,762
Thank you.

109
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:23,577
Good morning.

110
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:25,291
You’re just in time.

111
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:49,623
Hey, you there.

112
00:08:50,782 --> 00:08:51,648
Wanna sit here?

113
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:54,238
You look like you’d be a good student.

114
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:55,616
Sit with me.

115
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:58,097
Thanks.

116
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,691
What? Do we need all those textbooks this semester?

117
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:09,808
We do.

118
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:11,865
You didn’t see our class schedule?

119
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:17,309
You didn’t bring a single book?

120
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:29,143
Listen up!

121
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:35,477
I have been appointed by the teacher as the temporary class president

122
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,074
because I have been studying here since junior high.

123
00:09:38,924 --> 00:09:43,408
I welcome back old faces, and welcome new ones to our school.

124
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:45,490
These are…

125
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,148
Fahsai, vice president.

126
00:09:47,677 --> 00:09:48,994
Min-min, secretary.

127
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:52,322
They’re my administrative team.

128
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,677
- Feel free to talk to us. - Feel free to talk to us.

129
00:09:57,817 --> 00:10:01,142
Here’s the first assignment of this semester.

130
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:04,457
Since it’s the first day of high school,

131
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:09,768
the teacher wants us to write a letter to the new friend sitting next to us.

132
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:14,072
What if I’ve known the guy next to me since junior high?

133
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,943
Think of him as a new friend.

134
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,133
High school is like a new start anyway.

135
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:23,568
Lily, dear, can I write to the girls in the next class over instead?

136
00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:24,860
No, you can’t.

137
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:27,702
The teacher said you’re supposed to write to the student next to you.

138
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:28,777
Next to me…

139
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,208
But that’s this nerd.

140
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:31,457
Correct.

141
00:10:32,654 --> 00:10:33,457
What’s your name?

142
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,204
My name is New.

143
00:10:36,214 --> 00:10:36,908
And you?

144
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:38,665
Tao.

145
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:41,096
No need to be so polite with me.

146
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,111
I’m pretty laid back.

147
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:44,402
Yes, Mr. Tao.

148
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:45,237
Come on.

149
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:49,795
Hurry up, Chad. We’re late.

150
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:50,903
Hurry!

151
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:55,044
Hey, Chad! Wait for me!

152
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:56,374
Don’t leave me behind.

153
00:10:56,968 --> 00:10:57,571
Chad.

154
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,210
Quickly, guys. You’re late.

155
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:01,422
Close the gate.

156
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,866
Stop it, right there.

157
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,130
What’s your name? What grade are you from?

158
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:15,960
Which class? Tell me your student number.

159
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,605
I’m Chadjen.

160
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:19,100
Grade 10, Class 2.

161
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:19,860
My number is…

162
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:26,217
My number is 4830805.

163
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:32,097
4830805 is marked as ‘Late.’

164
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:36,217
But Miss, we were just in time.

165
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:38,168
Please don’t mark us late.

166
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,841
4830…

167
00:11:47,219 --> 00:11:48,179
Stay put!

168
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:51,373
You’re in the same class, aren’t you?

169
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,266
Yes.

170
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,936
I’ll find you anyway.

171
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,564
Go on. Get to class.

172
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:03,905
You didn’t have to tell her your name.

173
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,102
We weren’t late.

174
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:06,540
But I already did.

175
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:09,223
You don’t have to next time.

176
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:10,943
Are you going to tell everyone anything just because they ask?

177
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:12,811
What are you, a dummy?

178
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:22,450
What did you say your name was?

179
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:24,918
Sassawat.

180
00:12:25,102 --> 00:12:26,080
Sassawat…

181
00:12:27,134 --> 00:12:28,991
Chad, wait for me.

182
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:39,014
You can sit here.

183
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:41,291
May I?

184
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:49,788
I’m Khao.

185
00:12:50,722 --> 00:12:53,614
The teacher assigned us to write a letter to the friend sitting next to us.

186
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,149
What's your name?

187
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:57,360
Som-O.

188
00:12:57,628 --> 00:12:58,712
Just call me Som.

189
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:03,696
You know that hot guy over there?

190
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:06,964
He’s my friend.

191
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:14,208
Hey.

192
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,103
You two are late.

193
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,503
Be on time from now on.

194
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,662
We don’t want latecomers in this class.

195
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,512
They’re right.

196
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,931
Now I have to explain the assignment all over again.

197
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:41,672
You’re Chadjen, aren’t you?

198
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:46,001
You are!

199
00:13:46,946 --> 00:13:50,545
You’re the country’s top ONET test-taker last year.

200
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:58,242
You know Chadjen the Genius?

201
00:13:59,302 --> 00:13:59,957
What?

202
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:02,411
He’s famous in other schools?

203
00:14:03,305 --> 00:14:04,108
Genius, my foot.

204
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:09,505
Chadjen, the instructions are on the board.

205
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:22,207
Good morning, class.

206
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,428
Welcome to your first day of school.

207
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,617
(Oh, no. It’s the teacher from this morning.)

208
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:32,416
Miss, I’ve instructed the class for you.

209
00:14:33,007 --> 00:14:34,309
Thank you, Lily.

210
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,896
I’m your homeroom teacher

211
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:40,013
and I want you to write a letter to the friend next to you.

212
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:42,469
Think of it as a quick introduction.

213
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:46,697
Follow the formal letter-writing form so you can practice, too.

214
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:53,859
If you don’t know how to write that, feel free to take a look at mine.

215
00:14:57,226 --> 00:14:58,774
Enough of that.

216
00:14:59,229 --> 00:14:59,851
Listen up.

217
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:01,472
I want you to introduce yourself to class.

218
00:15:01,488 --> 00:15:05,617
Say your legal name, surname, and nickname so your friend knows whom to write to.

219
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,740
Well, let’s start with…

220
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:12,405
The girl who’s hiding behind her bag.

221
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:14,475
We’ll start with you.

222
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:22,862
My name is Gewalin Asarattana.

223
00:15:23,494 --> 00:15:24,608
My nickname is Som-O.

224
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:28,311
Gewalin, marked as ‘Late.’

225
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:29,942
Okay.

226
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:31,277
Take your seat.

227
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,980
Next up.

228
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:35,967
Hello.

229
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,014
My name is Kwanta Jongjit.

230
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:39,920
My nickname is Khao.

231
00:15:42,678 --> 00:15:43,271
You there.

232
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,352
Hi.

233
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,348
I’m Sassawat Jongcharoenniyom.

234
00:15:49,463 --> 00:15:50,613
My nickname is New.

235
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,379
Next.

236
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:57,654
I’m Nakrob Sudpreecha. Nickname is Tao.

237
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,234
Quiet down and listen, guys.

238
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:12,274
I’m Chadjen.

239
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:14,822
Chadjen Paisarnsakul.

240
00:16:15,465 --> 00:16:16,499
My nickname is Chadjen.

241
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:20,059
Chadjen is both your legal name and nickname?

242
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,493
Yes.

243
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:34,397
Chadjen, wait.

244
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:35,909
Chadjen, hold on.

245
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:37,207
Wait for me.

246
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,100
Chadjen, you’re new here.

247
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,059
You probably don’t know your way around.

248
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,442
I’ll give you a tour.

249
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,365
I’m fine, thanks.

250
00:16:48,404 --> 00:16:49,702
Chadjen!

251
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:51,995
Do you seriously not remember me?

252
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:53,760
You don’t?

253
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:56,004
From this website.

254
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:57,939
Teen 8.

255
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,957
(Kulasatri Chonwanichsiri)

256
00:16:58,957 --> 00:16:59,690
I was also in the top 10 test-takers.
(Kulasatri Chonwanichsiri)

257
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:01,733
I was also in the top 10 test-takers.

258
00:17:01,878 --> 00:17:03,521
I was on Teen 8, too.

259
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:04,856
- Oh. - You remember now?

260
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,503
I think I saw you around on that website.

261
00:17:08,122 --> 00:17:10,859
Told you he remembers.

262
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:12,783
You should have just said so.

263
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:14,722
You really should have just said that.

264
00:17:14,736 --> 00:17:15,274
See?

265
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:17,634
Are you and Chadjen long time friends?

266
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,648
Longer than that girl has, for sure.

267
00:17:20,554 --> 00:17:21,629
I’ll bet.

268
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:23,299
Can we talk while we walk?

269
00:17:23,398 --> 00:17:24,610
We might not get a spot at the cafeteria otherwise.

270
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:26,117
You go on ahead.

271
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:27,551
I’m going to stop by at the library.

272
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,054
See? I was really on the list.

273
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:33,054
Excuse me. Make way!

274
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:36,619
Who the hell is she?

275
00:17:36,894 --> 00:17:37,482
Oh?

276
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,659
Let’s go have lunch.

277
00:17:40,844 --> 00:17:42,721
Chadjen, let’s have lunch.

278
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:44,230
Come this way.

279
00:17:44,336 --> 00:17:44,911
Come on.

280
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,591
Grab lunch with me.

281
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,611
Not this one.

282
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,808
“Forget Me Not.”

283
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:00,522
Looks good.

284
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:32,982
Som-O, is it?

285
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,139
Are you writing the letter for the assignment?

286
00:18:45,303 --> 00:18:48,814
But that isn’t Khao.

287
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:50,281
That’s Chadjen.

288
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:56,019
(His eyesight is way too good.)

289
00:18:57,817 --> 00:19:00,205
It’s still for the assignment.

290
00:19:00,814 --> 00:19:02,656
One more letter wouldn’t hurt, right?

291
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:07,066
But I heard you’ve known Chadjen for a long time.

292
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:09,300
I don’t think he counts as a “new friend.”

293
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:10,605
(The nerve!)

294
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:13,151
But I get it.

295
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:16,005
(He does?)

296
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,620
Excuse me.

297
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,908
What are all these romance novels for?

298
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:24,314
Romance novels?

299
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,937
Oh, these…

300
00:19:29,497 --> 00:19:33,964
I’m not very good with words so I’m looking for examples.

301
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,881
Do you want my help with anything?

302
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,475
Actually, I need a favor.

303
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:58,210
Are these all for Chadjen?

304
00:19:59,527 --> 00:20:00,232
No.

305
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:04,114
I have someone I want to give this to.

306
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,705
But I didn’t see her face.

307
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:09,222
It happened this morning.

308
00:20:09,383 --> 00:20:11,940
Someone ran me over and I dropped my glasses.

309
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:13,518
- And… - Your glasses.

310
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,314
- Someone picked them up for me. - Thank you.

311
00:20:16,444 --> 00:20:18,503
I only caught the back of her head.

312
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,677
When I put my glasses back on, she was already gone.

313
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:24,565
So I’d been looking for someone similar to her,

314
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:26,197
these are the candidates.

315
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:29,158
So you’re going to write all of them?

316
00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:30,502
Yes.

317
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:34,367
I only saw her back and not her face.

318
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,802
I can’t be sure who she actually is.

319
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,100
You’re weird.

320
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:44,675
You want me to be your Cupid delivering these love letters?

321
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,909
These aren’t love letters.

322
00:20:48,422 --> 00:20:51,482
It’s a thank you note that says I want to be friends with her.

323
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,505
Does that mean… you’re good at writing letters?

324
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:00,525
Not really.

325
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:02,567
I took inspiration from books.

326
00:21:03,343 --> 00:21:05,259
Can you help me write a letter, then?

327
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,931
To Chadjen?

328
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,016
I hope it’s not a love letter.

329
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:11,891
Of course not!

330
00:21:15,885 --> 00:21:16,805
It’s not.

331
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:18,964
I just want to write some poems on friendship.

332
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,807
Poems on friendship?

333
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,321
Aren’t they cute together?

334
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:45,111
Looks like a couple.

335
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,925
Let’s go home, Chadjen.

336
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:52,611
Wait, wait, Chadjen.

337
00:21:53,475 --> 00:21:54,672
I…

338
00:21:58,096 --> 00:21:58,645
Here.

339
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:02,106
Take it.

340
00:22:06,776 --> 00:22:10,097
I… want to get to know you better

341
00:22:10,158 --> 00:22:14,878
so I wrote you another letter besides the assigned one.

342
00:22:16,955 --> 00:22:19,254
I hope to get a reply.

343
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:25,402
Well, bye, then.

344
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:36,125
You’re done with your letter?

345
00:22:37,216 --> 00:22:37,783
Yeah.

346
00:22:38,308 --> 00:22:39,115
I’ll submit it soon.

347
00:22:39,677 --> 00:22:40,285
You?

348
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:43,228
I’m still writing.

349
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:47,389
But I found this one poem that reminds me of you today.

350
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,136
“Even if the world crumbles down,”

351
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,010
“I will follow you to the end of ghosttown.”

352
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,456
“Even if all that awaits is sneering frown—”

353
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,835
That’s from the epic Phra Aphai Mani.

354
00:23:07,697 --> 00:23:08,402
What was that, a joke?

355
00:23:09,565 --> 00:23:10,312
Stop it.

356
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:27,931
Chadjen.

357
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,645
How long have we known each other?

358
00:23:35,056 --> 00:23:37,011
Ten years, is it?

359
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,059
Ugh, you don’t have to tell him how many years it’s been.

360
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:43,743
We’ve known each other our entire lives.

361
00:23:48,148 --> 00:23:48,860
Chadjen…

362
00:23:50,146 --> 00:23:53,462
You must be wondering why I’m writing you this letter.

363
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:56,906
We’ve been friends for a long time.

364
00:23:58,776 --> 00:24:02,520
I’ve seen you ever since I was born.

365
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:09,594
You know, today is the first day of high school

366
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:13,768
but I don’t feel the difference at all.

367
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,420
The teacher asked us to write a letter to a new friend,

368
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,702
but when I think of friends…

369
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:25,917
The only person that comes to my mind is you.

370
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:32,140
Too bad we didn’t get to sit next to each other this year, isn’t it?

371
00:24:34,447 --> 00:24:36,256
I made us late.

372
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:38,503
That’s why we didn’t.

373
00:24:54,817 --> 00:24:55,411
Hey!

374
00:24:55,783 --> 00:24:56,343
You.

375
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,706
Are you eavesdropping?

376
00:24:58,327 --> 00:24:59,235
Eavesdropping?

377
00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:01,235
This is my pool.

378
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,896
It’s you who’s invading my turf so early in the morning.

379
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:07,200
Your turf?

380
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:07,760
Yep.

381
00:25:07,814 --> 00:25:08,859
This pool belongs to the school.

382
00:25:08,985 --> 00:25:10,096
It’s mine, too.

383
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,401
You…

384
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,305
It’s rude to point your finger at people.

385
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:17,140
What did you hear?

386
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:20,677
I heard…

387
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:32,611
Nothing.

388
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,568
I just got here.

389
00:25:38,296 --> 00:25:39,308
Whatever.

390
00:25:40,543 --> 00:25:43,325
Don’t tell anyone anything you heard.

391
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:45,004
Got it?

392
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:46,020
Yes, ma’am.

393
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:24,269
Is it supposed to be “where” with places?

394
00:26:31,543 --> 00:26:32,263
Gewalin.

395
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:40,320
You sure?

396
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,174
Nakrob.

397
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:47,810
Yes?

398
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:48,650
Did you just get to school?

399
00:26:49,155 --> 00:26:50,448
I’ve been here since this morning, Teach.

400
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:51,600
I was just at practice at the pool.

401
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:53,238
May I?

402
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:54,207
Hold on.

403
00:26:55,022 --> 00:26:58,037
Help Gewalin out with this basic English question.

404
00:27:07,152 --> 00:27:07,899
You know the answer?

405
00:27:08,202 --> 00:27:08,899
Easy-peasy.

406
00:27:15,456 --> 00:27:16,477
Incorrect.

407
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:19,417
Incorrect.

408
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,721
The answer is “how.”

409
00:27:21,737 --> 00:27:27,386
This sentence, “How do I live?” means how do I live.

410
00:27:31,094 --> 00:27:35,382
How do I live without you

411
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,127
I want to know

412
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,970
How do I live without you - Alright, alright, Kulasatri.

413
00:27:43,115 --> 00:27:43,951
Take a seat.

414
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:48,020
We’re in Basic English class, not Singing.

415
00:27:48,162 --> 00:27:49,724
Thank you, Miss.

416
00:28:05,546 --> 00:28:06,706
This is the safest way.

417
00:28:15,937 --> 00:28:16,635
Som-O.

418
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:24,900
It’s time to keep your promise.

419
00:28:33,485 --> 00:28:34,222
I think that’s her.

420
00:28:34,668 --> 00:28:35,222
Which one?

421
00:28:35,234 --> 00:28:36,136
That one.

422
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,367
You sure?

423
00:28:39,842 --> 00:28:42,912
Well, I am… not.

424
00:28:44,234 --> 00:28:45,628
I only saw her back, you remember?

425
00:28:46,647 --> 00:28:48,574
But she’s on top of the list.

426
00:28:50,414 --> 00:28:51,450
The rest is up to you, Som-O.

427
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:53,562
Me?

428
00:29:06,517 --> 00:29:07,925
Hey, look at my lips.

429
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:09,902
Oh, pretty.

430
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:13,465
Are you Maple?

431
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:16,260
I have something I want to ask you.

432
00:29:17,302 --> 00:29:18,321
You know me?

433
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:20,555
Yes.

434
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,134
It’s from that guy.

435
00:29:25,037 --> 00:29:26,648
He wants to get to know you but doesn’t know how to ask.

436
00:29:28,275 --> 00:29:28,920
What is it?

437
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,330
Oshi.

438
00:29:41,637 --> 00:29:42,328
What’s that?

439
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,598
“Hello, Maple…”

440
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:15,543
Guys, I’ve got news.

441
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,300
There’s a fight!

442
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,822
Follow me.

443
00:30:22,414 --> 00:30:23,077
This way.

444
00:30:26,094 --> 00:30:28,802
Why don’t you just kick me in the face if you’re going to say that?

445
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:30,217
I don’t want to kick you in the face.

446
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:31,696
It’s like you already did in this letter!

447
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,499
It crushed my heart.

448
00:30:33,906 --> 00:30:36,921
I really didn’t mean to, and I didn’t crush anything.

449
00:30:37,665 --> 00:30:38,921
My feet haven’t even moved.

450
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,065
Oh, isn’t he polite?

451
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:45,965
He’s got manners, something you guys don’t have.

452
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,820
Oh, right.

453
00:30:48,168 --> 00:30:49,998
Read what he wrote.

454
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:53,954
“Hello, Maple. I don’t know if you remember me.”

455
00:30:54,442 --> 00:30:55,531
“But I remember you.”

456
00:30:57,805 --> 00:30:59,942
“We met yesterday at the school gate.”

457
00:31:00,428 --> 00:31:01,565
“I dropped my glasses."

458
00:31:02,008 --> 00:31:03,165
"You picked them up.”

459
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,503
Love at first sight or something?

460
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,054
“Too bad I couldn’t see when you helped me.”

461
00:31:08,376 --> 00:31:11,659
“So I didn’t get a good look at you.”

462
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:14,662
Eww, did you borrow that pick-up line from your grandpa, nerd?

463
00:31:15,691 --> 00:31:16,465
No.

464
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:18,014
I wasn’t trying to pick anyone up.

465
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:23,819
Hey, nerd. Maple doesn't like that kind of talk.

466
00:31:24,395 --> 00:31:27,002
She really doesn’t, you get it?

467
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,026
What do you guys have to do with this?

468
00:31:29,114 --> 00:31:31,734
Oh, good question.

469
00:31:31,982 --> 00:31:32,983
Hey, pipsqueak.

470
00:31:33,551 --> 00:31:36,105
This got nothing to do with you so get out of our way.

471
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,299
Stop it.

472
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,551
What’s this all about?

473
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:46,835
These guys took New’s letter.

474
00:31:47,108 --> 00:31:48,259
And read it for everyone to hear.

475
00:31:49,936 --> 00:31:51,472
These guys did?

476
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,201
I didn’t know you could read.

477
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,237
Quite a gentleman there, aren’t you?

478
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,160
Let’s see you deal with someone your size.

479
00:32:01,174 --> 00:32:02,114
Ow, ow, oww!

480
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:04,266
Help me.

481
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,524
Stop bullying the girls and this newbie.

482
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,217
And remember this girl’s face

483
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,167
because she’s the girl I’m…

484
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:17,426
The girl you’re what?

485
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:21,413
That’s none of your business!

486
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,152
Hey.

487
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:23,908
The teachers are here.

488
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:25,979
Oh, crap. Let’s go.

489
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,130
Hurry up.

490
00:32:27,954 --> 00:32:28,840
Run!

491
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,349
That was really cool.

492
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:37,520
Sorry I’m late.

493
00:32:42,303 --> 00:32:43,517
Alright. Let’s go back to class.

494
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,865
Your glasses.

495
00:32:57,835 --> 00:32:58,554
Thank you.

496
00:33:07,257 --> 00:33:08,244
(So it was Khao.)

497
00:33:24,573 --> 00:33:25,112
Here.

498
00:33:26,616 --> 00:33:27,207
Oh!

499
00:33:31,005 --> 00:33:32,419
You’re a good artist, Som.

500
00:33:33,894 --> 00:33:35,469
An illustrated letter…

501
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:37,182
That’s a good idea.

502
00:33:38,992 --> 00:33:40,940
“Good morning, Mr. Tao.”

503
00:33:42,177 --> 00:33:45,614
Nerd, I told you to talk to me like a normal person.

504
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,346
This is just how I talk.

505
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:51,877
Why do I get an empty piece of paper, though?

506
00:33:52,385 --> 00:33:53,657
I just couldn’t get into this letter-writing thing.

507
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,971
That’s disappointing.

508
00:33:56,288 --> 00:33:57,745
Fine. I’ll write you something.

509
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,383
What do you want me to write?

510
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:02,777
“Love.”

511
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,800
Oh, well.

512
00:34:06,617 --> 00:34:08,121
You’re hurt, huh?

513
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:10,314
This is me trying my best.

514
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,477
Chad, did you get the letter?

515
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:22,761
(Wait, that isn’t mine.)

516
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,957
Listen up.

517
00:34:31,974 --> 00:34:35,124
It’s only been a few days and someone has already started a fight at school?

518
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,318
We’re in school, not a boxing academy.

519
00:34:39,348 --> 00:34:41,920
I don’t see anyone walking around with boxing gloves.

520
00:34:42,189 --> 00:34:42,991
Sassawat.

521
00:34:43,613 --> 00:34:44,537
Be quiet.

522
00:34:46,357 --> 00:34:49,293
Who was it? Who started it?

523
00:34:50,225 --> 00:34:54,205
Confess right now or I’ll punish you all.

524
00:34:55,832 --> 00:34:56,939
This is the person who started it.

525
00:34:58,893 --> 00:35:03,468
A student told me someone in your class wrote a love letter to one of my students.

526
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:05,471
It isn’t a love letter.

527
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:08,205
So it was you.

528
00:35:08,924 --> 00:35:10,157
How dare you argue with me.

529
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,016
Give me all the letters.

530
00:35:16,391 --> 00:35:17,165
Som-O.

531
00:35:20,502 --> 00:35:21,240
Som-O?

532
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:23,511
Did you write them, too?

533
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,071
No.

534
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,503
I was just keeping the letters for him.

535
00:35:31,265 --> 00:35:34,114
Give them to me and you won’t be severely punished.

536
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:38,977
All of them.

537
00:36:08,768 --> 00:36:09,814
Crap…

538
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:15,220
Look.

539
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,306
I believe the content inside these letters are more or less similar

540
00:36:20,213 --> 00:36:21,432
since the envelopes look all the same.

541
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:28,414
Except for this one.

542
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,903
Sir.

543
00:36:44,865 --> 00:36:45,647
That one is mine.

544
00:36:46,548 --> 00:36:47,259
Yours?

545
00:36:48,354 --> 00:36:48,882
Yes.

546
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:49,928
Good.

547
00:36:50,871 --> 00:36:52,411
Tell me what’s inside.

548
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:54,820
Listen.

549
00:36:55,659 --> 00:36:57,177
Don’t take the blame for your friend.

550
00:36:57,797 --> 00:36:59,549
If your friend is in the wrong, you should let them take the punishment.

551
00:37:00,062 --> 00:37:01,383
Don’t take the blame.

552
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:07,505
You all should know letters like these are against the school’s rules.

553
00:37:08,564 --> 00:37:09,946
Which one, exactly?

554
00:37:12,505 --> 00:37:13,749
These are love letters.

555
00:37:14,371 --> 00:37:17,708
The school forbids students to write letters of this nature

556
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,773
because we do not support alliances.

557
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,120
Mr. Yong.

558
00:37:23,334 --> 00:37:24,802
Do you mean “dalliances”?

559
00:37:28,764 --> 00:37:29,370
Thank you.

560
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:31,226
I did mean dalliances.

561
00:37:31,691 --> 00:37:32,973
Did you read any of it?

562
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,429
The content is very much platonic.

563
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,242
Do not argue with me.

564
00:37:39,063 --> 00:37:40,850
Look. I’ve got one, too.

565
00:37:41,823 --> 00:37:42,585
Me, too.

566
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,133
Same here.

567
00:37:44,802 --> 00:37:45,712
So have I.

568
00:37:46,654 --> 00:37:48,379
Alright, put this down, guys.

569
00:37:49,807 --> 00:37:51,379
I totally forgot.

570
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,708
I assigned the students to write a letter

571
00:37:54,952 --> 00:37:57,619
to get to know their new friend on the first day of school.

572
00:38:00,037 --> 00:38:01,348
It’s still inappropriate.

573
00:38:02,642 --> 00:38:03,962
The color is pink.

574
00:38:05,207 --> 00:38:06,552
The purpose is clear enough.

575
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,478
Maybe pink is just their favorite color.

576
00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:12,773
It doesn’t mean it’s a love letter.

577
00:38:12,928 --> 00:38:15,112
Oh, look at your students.

578
00:38:15,662 --> 00:38:16,782
All of them love arguing with teachers.

579
00:38:17,025 --> 00:38:19,114
You need to punish all of them,

580
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:21,312
otherwise I’ll report this to the Principal.

581
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,042
Of course.

582
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:25,011
I’ll deal with them.

583
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:27,020
What did we do wrong?

584
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:30,265
You’re wrong for starting a fight in school

585
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,865
causing trouble for everyone else.

586
00:38:33,506 --> 00:38:35,103
Well, then, that one was all on me.

587
00:38:36,354 --> 00:38:37,314
None of my friends had anything to do with it.

588
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:41,545
You love your friends so much, huh?

589
00:38:41,783 --> 00:38:43,051
Deal with your students.

590
00:38:43,242 --> 00:38:44,748
I don’t want to spend another minute talking to any of them.

591
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:48,131
Careful, Mr. Yong.

592
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:52,460
Hey, hey, all of you, quiet down.

593
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:53,628
Sit down.

594
00:38:54,946 --> 00:38:57,714
I guess that assignment was a mistake.

595
00:38:57,948 --> 00:38:59,777
It’s clearly gotten so out of hand.

596
00:39:00,202 --> 00:39:00,780
Nakrob.

597
00:39:01,017 --> 00:39:01,416
Yes?

598
00:39:01,435 --> 00:39:05,434
Sassawat, Kwanta, Gewalin, Chadjen.

599
00:39:05,866 --> 00:39:07,820
All five of you must stay after class and clean up this classroom.

600
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,869
But—

601
00:39:09,882 --> 00:39:11,521
Kwanta, sit down.

602
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,420
Help me out here.

603
00:39:16,013 --> 00:39:18,115
We need to show them that I'm holding you responsible for your actions.

604
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:20,405
Do it for me.

605
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:24,797
Kulasatri, collect all the letters.

606
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,714
- Yes, ma’am. - Be quick about it.

607
00:39:35,885 --> 00:39:37,108
Come on, it’s just cleaning up.

608
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:39,205
Don’t worry.

609
00:39:40,694 --> 00:39:43,897
The rest of you, get your things ready for class.

610
00:40:04,564 --> 00:40:05,610
Where did it go?

611
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:14,325
That was too bad, wasn’t it?

612
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:20,705
But on the bright side, I know who that girl is now.

613
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,189
Oh, how nice for you.

614
00:40:22,445 --> 00:40:24,395
Don’t tell me. I don’t wanna know anymore.

615
00:40:30,574 --> 00:40:32,958
Why do I gotta do this?

616
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:41,720
You’re not gonna do anything, nerd?

617
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,325
Thanks.

618
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,408
It’s alright.

619
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:47,610
For you—

620
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:50,794
I mean, I’ll help a friend out any time.

621
00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:57,350
But you guys agree that Mr. Yong was overreacting, right?

622
00:40:57,736 --> 00:41:00,420
They’re just letters, like, what’s the big deal?

623
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,179
Yeah.

624
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,320
He was awful.

625
00:41:04,641 --> 00:41:07,131
Thank you, all of you.

626
00:41:08,242 --> 00:41:09,097
I mean it.

627
00:41:09,991 --> 00:41:10,690
Alright.

628
00:41:11,229 --> 00:41:12,404
Let’s clean this place up.

629
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:14,398
Let’s do it.

630
00:41:15,016 --> 00:41:16,429
Take this, nerd.

631
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,099
Can I ask you something?

632
00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:21,637
That letter was supposed to go to Chadjen, wasn’t it?

633
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:27,278
How’d you know that?

634
00:41:28,394 --> 00:41:33,300
There’s a drawing of a guy who looks exactly like Chadjen, how else!

635
00:41:33,962 --> 00:41:35,554
I just guessed it was probably your drawing.

636
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:38,500
Does that mean everyone else realizes that, too?

637
00:41:41,352 --> 00:41:42,731
My life is over.

638
00:41:45,521 --> 00:41:46,595
It’s alright.

639
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:48,520
Let’s get this done.

640
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:51,968
Hey.

641
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:53,419
Hi.

642
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:56,970
Hey.

643
00:41:57,112 --> 00:41:58,505
- What? - You’re late.

644
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:00,457
Coach asked me to give you this.

645
00:42:00,546 --> 00:42:01,090
Really?

646
00:42:01,112 --> 00:42:01,666
Yeah.

647
00:42:02,986 --> 00:42:03,641
What is it?

648
00:42:08,057 --> 00:42:08,862
Hello, Dad?

649
00:42:09,388 --> 00:42:10,222
You’re late.

650
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,517
Sorry, Dad– I mean, Coach.

651
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,773
I was late because I had to clean the classroom.

652
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,605
There’ll be a new member in our club tomorrow.

653
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,303
Be prepared to welcome him.

654
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:21,822
Yes, Dad.

655
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,868
He won the junior championship last year.

656
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,407
The same year you got injured.

657
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,066
It’s your chance to get back at him.

658
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,093
Yes, Dad.

659
00:42:44,216 --> 00:42:46,380
Mom is definitely giving me an earful when we get home.

660
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,534
I’ll help you talk to her.

661
00:42:54,001 --> 00:42:55,617
Good thing we take a cab.

662
00:42:57,813 --> 00:42:58,471
Yeah.

663
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:05,002
Thanks for speaking up for me today, Chad.

664
00:44:32,613 --> 00:44:33,416
Chadjen.

665
00:44:33,626 --> 00:44:35,431
Come straight home from school tomorrow, alright?

666
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,832
I’ll land in Bangkok in the evening.

667
00:44:39,118 --> 00:44:42,282
I said I’d visit after a year, right?

668
00:44:42,503 --> 00:44:43,805
Did you forget that?

669
00:44:51,383 --> 00:44:52,149
No, I didn’t.

670
00:44:54,084 --> 00:44:55,160
I didn’t forget, Mom.

671
00:44:56,988 --> 00:44:58,242
I miss you, dear.

672
00:44:58,574 --> 00:44:59,588
See you tomorrow.

673
00:45:56,801 --> 00:45:57,986
Hello, Aunt Aun.

674
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,405
Surprise.

675
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:02,656
Your mother is back in town?

676
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,202
You know why I’m back, Chad.

677
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,235
Take my advice.

678
00:46:07,312 --> 00:46:10,327
You gotta keep an eye on your daughter,

679
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,857
especially at her age.

680
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:15,853
Otherwise, you’re in for some classic drama.

681
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:29,214
It’s a tie.

682
00:46:29,524 --> 00:46:31,727
Next time, it won’t be a tie.

683
00:46:31,779 --> 00:46:33,481
Tao, your only option is victory.

684
00:46:34,257 --> 00:46:35,731
A tie means defeat.

685
00:46:36,136 --> 00:46:36,771
Remember that.

686
00:46:37,136 --> 00:46:37,688
Go!

687
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,819
Tao, go for it!

688
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:45,008
Som, trade that cheer banner with my gold medal.

689
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:47,610
You have to decide, Chad.

690
00:46:48,441 --> 00:46:49,891
If you don’t,

691
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:51,220
I’ll make you.
